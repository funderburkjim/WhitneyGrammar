There is, however, a marked difference between the earlier and the later language as regards the length and intricacy of the combinations allowed. In Veda and Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, it is quite rare that more than two stems are compounded together \u2014 except that to some much used and familiar compound, as to an integral word, a further element is sometimes added. But the later the period, and, especially, the more elaborate the style, the more a cumbrous and difficult aggregate of elements, abnegating the advantages of an inflective language, takes the place of the due syntactical union of formed words into sentences. \n\n1247. Sanskrit compounds fall into three principal classes: \n\nI. a. Copulative or aggregative compounds, of which the members are syntactically co\u00f6rdinate: a joining together into one of words which in an uncompounded condition would be connected by the conjunction ''and'' (rarely ''or'').<section end=\"chapter18\" /><noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"397665":{"pageid":397665,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/509","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\nb.

The members of such a compound may obviously be of any number, two or more than two. No compound of any other class can contain more than two members \u2014 of which, however, either or both may be compound, or decompound (below, 1248). \n\nII. d. Determinative compounds, of which the former member is syntactically dependent on the latter, as its determining or qualifying adjunct: being either, 1. a noun (or pronoun) limiting it in a case-relation, or, 2. an adjective or adverb describing it. And, according as it is the one or the other, are to be distinguished the two sub-classes: A. Dependent compounds; and B. Descriptive compounds. Their difference is not an absolute one. \n\ne. Examples are: of dependent compounds, <tt>amitrasen\u0101\u0301</tt> ''army of enemies'', <tt>p\u0101dodaka</tt> ''water for the feet'', <tt>\u0101yurd\u0101\u0301</tt> ''life-giving'', <tt>h\u00e1stak\u1e5bta</tt> ''made with the hands''; of descriptive compounds, <tt>mahar\u1e63\u00ed</tt> ''great sage'', <tt>priyasakhi</tt> ''dear friend'', <tt>am\u00edtra</tt> ''enemy'', <tt>s\u00fak\u1e5bta</tt> ''well done''. \n\nf. These two classes are of primary value; they have undergone no unifying modification in the process of composition; their character as parts of speech is determined by their final member, and they are capable of being resolved into equivalent phrases by giving the proper independent form and formal means of connection to each member. That is not the case with the remaining class, which accordingly is more fundamentally distinct from them than they are from one another. \n\nIII. g. Secondary adjective compounds, the value of which is not given by a simple resolution into their component parts, but which, though having as final member a noun, are themselves adjectives. These, again, are of two sub-classes: A. Possessive compounds, which are noun-compounds of the preceding class, with the idea of ''possessing'' added, turning them from nouns into adjectives; B. Compounds in which the second member is a noun syntactically dependent on the first: namely, 1. Prepositional compounds, of a governing preposition and following noun;<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"397676":{"pageid":397676,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/517","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><center>II. Determinative Compounds.</center> \n\n1262. A noun or adjective is often combined into a compound with a preceding determining or qualifying word \u2014 a noun, or adjective, or adverb. Such a compound is conveniently called determinative. \n\n1263. This is the class of compounds which is of most general and frequent occurrence in all branches of Indo-European language. Its two principal divisions have been already pointed out: thus, A. Dependent compounds, in which the prior member is a substantive word (noun or pronoun or substantively used adjective), standing to the other member in the relation of a case dependent on it; and B. Descriptive compounds, in which the prior member is an adjective, or other word having the value of an adjective, qualifying a noun; or else an adverb or its equivalent, qualifying an adjective. Each of these divisions then falls into two sub-divisions, according as the final member, and therefore the whole compound, is a noun or an adjective. \n\na. The whole class of determinatives is called by the Hindu grammarians <tt>tatpuru\u1e63a</tt> (the term is a specimen of the class, meaning ''his man''); and the second division, the descriptives, has the special name of <tt>karmadh\u0101raya</tt> (of obscure application: the literal sense is something like ''office-bearing''). After their example, the two divisions are in European usage widely known by these two names respectively. \n\n<center>A. Dependent Compounds.</center> \n\n1264. Dependent Noun-compounds. In this division, the case-relation of the prior member to the other may be of any kind; but, in accordance with the usual relations of one noun to another, it is oftenest genitive, and least often accusative. \n\na. Examples are: of genitive relation, <tt>devasen\u0101\u0301</tt> ''army of gods'', <tt>yamad\u016bt\u00e1</tt> ''Yama's messenger'', <tt>j\u012bvalok\u00e1</tt> ''the world of the living'', <tt>{{hws|indra|indradhan\u00fas}}</tt><noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"397678":{"pageid":397678,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/524","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>it is greatly extended, and forms a numerous class of appositional compounds: see below, 1302. \n\nf. This whole subdivision, of nouns with preceding qualifying adjectives, is not uncommon; but it is greatly (in AV., for example, more than five times) exceeded in frequency by the sub-class of possessives of the same form: see below, 1298. \n\n1281. The adverbial words which are most freely and commonly used as prior members of compounds, qualifying the final member, are the verbal prefixes and the words of direction related with them, and the inseparable prefixes, <tt>a</tt> or <tt>an, su, dus</tt>, etc. (1121). These are combined not only with adjectives, but also, in quasi-adjectival value, with nouns; and the two classes of combinations will best be treated together. \n\n1282. Verbal adjectives and nouns with preceding adverbs. As the largest and most important class under this head might properly enough be regarded the derivatives with preceding verbal prefixes. These, however, have been here reckoned rather as derivatives from roots combined with prefixes (1141), and have been treated under the head of derivation, in the preceding chapter. In taking up the others, we will begin with the participles. \n\n1283. The participles belonging to the tense-systems \u2014 those in <tt>ant</tt> (or <tt>at</tt>), <tt>m\u0101na, \u0101na, v\u0101\u1e45s</tt> \u2014 are only rarely compounded with any other adverbial element than the negative <tt>a</tt> or <tt>an</tt>, which then takes the accent. \n\na. Examples are: <tt>\u00e1nadant, \u00e1dadat, \u00e1na\u00e7nant, \u00e1sravant, \u00e1lubhyant, \u00e1d\u0101syant, \u00e1ditsant, \u00e1devayant; \u00e1manyam\u0101na, \u00e1hi\u1e45s\u0101na, \u00e1chidyam\u0101na; \u00e1dadiv\u0101\u1e45s, \u00e1bibh\u012bv\u0101\u1e45s, atasth\u0101na</tt>; and, with verbal prefixes, <tt>\u00e1napasphurant, \u00e1n\u0101gami\u1e63yant, \u00e1nabhy\u0101gami\u1e63yant, \u00e1vir\u0101dhayant, \u00e1vic\u0101calat, \u00e1pratimany\u016byam\u0101na</tt>. \n\nb. Exceptions in regard to accent are very few: <tt>arundhat\u012b\u0301, aj\u00e1rant\u012b, acod\u00e1nt</tt> (RV., once: doubtless a false reading; the simple participle is <tt>c\u00f3dant</tt>); AV. has <tt>anip\u00e1dyam\u0101na</tt> for RV. <tt>\u00e1nipadyam\u0101na</tt> (and the published text has <tt>asa\u1e41y\u00e1nt</tt>, with a part of the manuscripts); \u00c7B. has <tt>ak\u0101m\u00e1yam\u0101na</tt>. \n\nc.

One or two exceptional cases may be noted, as follows: \n\na. An adjective is sometimes preceded by a noun standing toward it in a quasi-adverbial relation expressive of comparison or likeness: e. g. <tt>\u00e7\u00fakababhru</tt> (VS.) ''parrot-brown'', <tt>\u016b\u0301r\u1e47\u0101m\u1e5bdu</tt> (TB.)

An adjective is now and then qualified by another adjective: e. g. <tt>k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101ita</tt> ''dark-gray'', <tt>dh\u016bmr\u00e1rohita</tt> ''grayish red'': and compare the adjectives of intermediate direction, 1257 c. \n\nc. The adjective <tt>p\u016brva</tt> is in the later language frequently used as final member of a compound in which its logical value is that of an adverb qualifying the other member (which is said to retain its own accent). Thus, <tt>d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dap\u016brva</tt> ''previously seen'', <tt>pari\u1e47\u012btap\u016brva</tt> ''already married'', <tt>aparij\u00f1\u0101tap\u016brva</tt> ''not before known'', <tt>somap\u012btap\u016brva</tt> ''having formerly drunk soma'', <tt>str\u012bp\u016brva</tt> ''formerly a woman''. \n\n<center>III. Secondary Adjective Compounds.</center> \n\n1292. a. A compound having a noun as its final member very often wins secondarily the value of an adjective, being inflected in the three genders to agree with the noun which it qualifies, and used in all the constructions of an adjective. \n\nb. This class of compounds, as was pointed out above (1247. III.), falls into the two divisions of A. Possessives, having their adjective character given them by addition of the idea of ''possessing''; and B. those in which the final member is syntactically dependent on or governed by the prior member. \n\n<center>A. Possessive Compounds.</center> \n\n1293. The possessives are noun-compounds of the preceding class, determinatives, of all its various subdivisions, to which is given an adjective inflection, and which take on an adjective meaning of a kind which is most conveniently and accurately defined by adding <tt>having</tt> or <tt>possessing</tt> to the meaning of the determinative. \n\na.

Examples are: <tt>v\u012brasena</tt> ''possessing a hero-army'', <tt>praj\u0101k\u0101ma</tt> ''having desire of progeny'', <tt>tigm\u00e1\u00e7\u1e5bn\u0304ga</tt> ''sharphorned'', <tt>h\u00e1ritasraj</tt> ''wearing green garlands''; <tt>atim\u0101tr\u00e1</tt> ''excessive''; <tt>y\u0101vay\u00e1ddve\u1e63as</tt> ''driving away enemies''. \n\nj. The adjective compounds are, like simple adjectives, liable to be used, especially in the neuter, as abstract and collective nouns, and in the accusative as adverbs; and out of these uses have grown apparent special classes of compounds, reckoned and named as such by the Hindu grammarians. The relation of the classification given above to that presented in the native grammar, and widely adopted from the latter by the European grammars, will be made clear as we go on to treat the classes in detail. \n\n1248. A compound may, like a simple word, become a member in another compound, and this in yet another \u2014 and so on, without definite limit. The analysis of any compound, of whatever length (unless it be a copulative), must be made by a succession of bisections. \n\na. Thus, the dependent compound <tt>p\u016brvajanmak\u1e5bta</tt> ''done in a previous existence'' is first divisible into <tt>k\u1e5bta</tt> and the descriptive <tt>p\u016brvajanman</tt>, then this into its elements; the dependent <tt>sakalan\u012bti\u00e7\u0101stratattvaj\u00f1a</tt> ''knowing the essence of all books of behavior'' has first the root-stem <tt>j\u00f1a</tt> (for \u221a<tt>j\u00f1\u0101</tt>) ''knowing'' separated from the rest, which is again dependent; then this is divided into <tt>tattva</tt> ''essence'' and the remainder, which is descriptive; this, again, divides into <tt>sakala</tt> ''all'' and <tt>n\u012bti\u00e7\u0101stra</tt> ''books of behavior'', of which the latter is a dependent compound and the former a possessive (<tt>sa</tt> and <tt>kal\u0101</tt> ''having its parts together''). \n\n1249. a. The final of a stem is combined with the initial of another stem in composition according to the general rules for external combination: they have been given, with their exceptions, in chap. III., above. \n\nb. If a stem has a distinction of strong and weak forms, it regularly enters into composition as prior member in its weak form; or, if it has a triple distinction (311), in its middle form.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"415489":{"pageid":415489,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/542","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><center>Anomalous Compounds.</center>\n\n1314. As in every language, compounds are now and then met with which are of anomalous character, as exhibiting combinations of elements not usually put together, or not after such a method, or for such a purpose. Some of these, especially of those occurring in the old language, may well be noticed here.\n\na. Compounds having a particle as final member: as, <tt>aprat\u00ed</tt> ''having no equal'', <tt>tuviprat\u00ed</tt> ''mightily opposing'', <tt>\u00e1tath\u0101</tt> ''refusing'', <tt>vitatha</tt> ''false'', <tt>yath\u0101tath\u00e1</tt> ''as it really is'', <tt>s\u00fasaha</tt> ''prosperity in companionship'', <tt>aniha</tt> and <tt>anamutra</tt> ''having no here'' and ''no yonder'', etc.\n\nb. Agglomerations of two or more elements out of phrases: thus, <tt>ahamp\u016brv\u00e1</tt> ''eager to be first'', <tt>ahamuttar\u00e1</tt> ''contest for preeminence'', <tt>mamasaty\u00e1</tt> ''contest for possession'', <tt>itih\u0101s\u00e1</tt> ''legend'' (<tt>iti h\u0101 \u201dsa</tt> ''thus, indeed, it was''), <tt>nagham\u0101r\u00e1</tt> and <tt>nagh\u0101ri\u1e63\u00e1</tt> ''not, surely, dying'' or ''coming to harm'', <tt>kuv\u00edtsa</tt> ''some unknown person'', <tt>tad\u00eddartha</tt> ''having just that as aim'', <tt>k\u016bcidarth\u00edn</tt> ''having errands in every direction'', <tt>k\u0101citkar\u00e1</tt> ''doing all sorts of things'', <tt>kuhacidv\u00edd</tt> ''wherever found'', <tt>akuta\u00e7cidbhaya</tt> ''out of all danger'', <tt>yadbhavi\u1e63ya<tt/> ''What-is-to-be'', etc.\n\nc. Agglomerations in which the prior member retains a syntactic form: as, <tt>anyonya</tt> and <tt>paraspara</tt> ''one another'', <tt>avaraspara</tt> ''inverted''.\n\nd. Aggregations with the natural order inverted: e. g. <tt>pit\u0101mah\u00e1</tt> and <tt>tat\u0101mah\u00e1</tt> ''grandfather'', <tt>putrahata</tt> ''with his sons slain'', <tt>j\u0101nv\u0101kn\u00e1</tt> and -<tt>j\u0101nvakta</tt> ''with bended knee'', <tt>dantaj\u0101ta</tt> ''provided with teeth'', <tt>som\u0101pah\u1e5bt\u00e1</tt> ''deprived of soma'', <tt>pan\u0304kt\u00edr\u0101dhas</tt> ''having groups of gifts'', <tt>gojara</tt> ''old bull'', <tt>agrajihv\u00e1, agran\u0101sik\u0101</tt>, etc. ''tip of the tongue'', ''of the nose'', etc. Compare also 1291 c.\n\ne. Aggregations of particles were pointed out above (1111 a); also (1122 e) cases in which <tt>n\u00e1</tt> and <tt>m\u0101\u0301</tt> are used in composition.\n\nf. In late Sanskrit (perhaps after the false analogy of combinations like <tt>tad anu</tt>, viewed as <tt>tadanu</tt>, with tad as stem instead of neuter accusative), a preposition is sometimes compounded as final member with the noun governed by it: e. g. <tt>v\u1e5bk\u1e63\u0101dhas</tt> or <tt>v\u1e5bk\u1e63\u0101dhast\u0101t</tt> ''under the tree'', <tt>dant\u0101nta\u1e25</tt> ''between the teeth'', <tt>bhavanopari</tt> ''on top of the house'', <tt>satyavin\u0101</tt> ''without truth''.\n\n<center>Stem-finals altered in Composition.</center>\n\n1315. Transfers to an <tt>a</tt>-form of declension from other less common finals, which are not rare in independent use, are especially common in the final members of compounds. Thus:\n\na. A stem in an often drops its final consonant (compare 429 a, 437): examples are <tt>ak\u1e63a, adhva, arva, astha, aha, tak\u1e63a, brahma, m\u016brdha, r\u0101ja, loma, v\u1e5b\u1e63a, \u00e7va, saktha, s\u0101ma</tt>.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"415490":{"pageid":415490,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/541","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><tt>s\u00e1h\u1e5bdaya</tt> ''heartiness'', <tt>sudiv\u00e1</tt> ''prosperity by day'', <tt>sum\u1e5bg\u00e1</tt> and <tt>su\u00e7akun\u00e1</tt> ''prosperity with beasts and birds''. Feminines of like use are not quotable from RV. or AV.; later occur such as <tt>tri\u00e7at\u012b</tt> ''three hundred'' (481), <tt>trilok\u012b</tt> ''the three worlds'', <tt>pa\u00f1cam\u016bl\u012b</tt> ''aggregate of five roots''.\n\nc. As the examples show, the accent of words thus used is various; but it is more prevailingly on the final syllable than in the adjective compounds in their ordinary use.\n\n1313. Those adverbially used accusatives of secondary adjective compounds which have an indeclinable or particle as prior member are reckoned by the Hindu grammarians as a separate class of compounds, and called by the name <tt>avyay\u012bbh\u0101va</tt>.\n\na. This term is a derivative from the compound verb (1094) made up of <tt>avyaya</tt> ''uninflected'' and \u221a<tt>bh\u016b</tt>, and means ''conversion to an indeclinable''.\n\nb. The prepositional compounds (1310) are especially frequent in this use: thus, for example, <tt>anu\u1e63vadh\u00e1m</tt> ''by one's own will'', <tt>abhip\u016brv\u00e1m</tt> and <tt>parovar\u00e1m</tt> ''in succession'', <tt>\u0101dv\u0101da\u00e7\u00e1m</tt> ''up to twelve'', <tt>pratido\u1e63\u00e1m</tt> ''at evening'', <tt>samak\u1e63\u00e1m</tt> ''in sight''. Instances given by the grammarians are: <tt>adhihari</tt> ''upon Hari'', <tt>upar\u0101jam</tt> ''with the king'', <tt>upanadam</tt> or <tt>upanadi</tt> ''near the river'', <tt>pratyagni</tt> ''toward the fire'', <tt>pratini\u00e7am</tt> ''every night'', <tt>nirmak\u1e63ikam</tt> ''with freedom from flies''.\n\nc. A large and important class is made up of words having a relative adverb, especially <tt>yath\u0101</tt>, as prior member. Thus, for example, <tt>yath\u0101va\u00e7\u00e1m</tt> ''as one chooses'' (<tt>v\u00e1\u00e7a</tt> ''will''), <tt>yath\u0101k\u1e5bt\u00e1m</tt> ''as done [before], according to usage'', <tt>yath\u0101n\u0101m\u00e1</tt> ''by name'', <tt>yath\u0101bh\u0101g\u00e1m</tt> ''according to several portion'', <tt>yath\u0101n\u0304g\u00e1m</tt> and <tt>yath\u0101par\u00fa</tt> ''limb by limb'', <tt>yatrak\u0101\u0301mam</tt> ''whither one will'', <tt>y\u0101vanm\u0101tr\u00e1m</tt> ''in some measure'', <tt>y\u0101vajj\u012bv\u00e1m</tt> ''as long as one lives'', <tt>y\u0101vats\u00e1bandhu</tt> ''according to the number of relations''.\n\nd. These compounds are not common in the old language; RV. has with <tt>yath\u0101</tt> only four of them, AV. only ten; and no such compound is used adjectively except <tt>y\u0101cchre\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> RV., <tt>y\u0101vacchre\u1e63\u1e6dh\u00e1</tt> AV. ''as good as possible''. \u00c7B. has <tt>yath\u0101k\u0101r\u00edn, yath\u0101c\u0101r\u00edn, y\u00e1th\u0101k\u0101ma, y\u00e1th\u0101kratu</tt> as adjectives (followed in each case by a correlative <tt>t\u00e1th\u0101</tt>). The adjective use in the later language also is quite rare as compared with the adverbial.\n\ne. Other cases than the accusative occasionally occur: thus, instrumental, as <tt>yath\u0101sa\u1e41khyena, yath\u0101\u00e7akty\u0101, yathepsay\u0101, yath\u0101pratigu\u1e47\u0101is</tt>; and ablative, as <tt>yath\u0101ucity\u0101t</tt>.\n\nf. A class of adverbs of frequent occurrence is made with <tt>sa</tt>: e. g. <tt>sakopam</tt> ''angrily'', <tt>s\u0101daram</tt> ''respectfully'', <tt>sasmitam</tt> ''with a smile'', <tt>savi\u00e7e\u1e63am</tt> ''especially''.\n\ng. Other adverbial compounds of equivalent character occur earlier, and are common later: for example, <tt>\u1e5btekarm\u00e1m</tt> ''without work'', <tt>n\u0101n\u0101rath\u00e1m</tt> ''on different chariots'', <tt>ubhayady\u00fas</tt> ''two days in succession'', <tt>citrapadakramam</tt> ''with wonderful progress'', <tt>prad\u0101nap\u016brvam</tt> ''with accompaniment of a gift;'' etc.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"415491":{"pageid":415491,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/540","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>''reaching old age'', <tt>\u0101dv\u0101da\u00e7\u00e1</tt> ''up to twelve;'' <tt>upakak\u1e63\u00e1</tt> ''reaching to the armpits'', <tt>upottam\u00e1</tt> ''next to last, penultimate;'' <tt>up\u00e1ribudhna</tt> ''above the bottom'', <tt>up\u00e1rimartya</tt> ''rising above mortals;'' <tt>tirojan\u00e1</tt> ''beyond people;'' <tt>ni\u1e25s\u0101l\u00e1</tt> ''cut of the house;'' <tt>parip\u00e1d</tt> ''(about the feet) snare'', <tt>parihast\u00e1</tt> ''about the hand, bracelet;'' <tt>par\u00f3k\u1e63a</tt> ''out of sight'', <tt>par\u00f3m\u0101tra</tt> ''beyond measure'', <tt>parogavy\u016bt\u00ed</tt> ''beyond the fields'', <tt>para\u1e25sahasr\u00e1</tt> (<tt>p\u00e1ra\u1e25sahasra</tt>, \u00c7B.)

A suffixal <tt>a</tt> is sometimes added to a final consonant, as in <tt>up\u0101nas\u00e1</tt> ''on the wagon'', <tt>\u0101vyu\u1e63\u00e1</tt> ''until daybreak''. In a few instances, the suffix <tt>ya</tt> is taken (see above, 1212 m); and in one word the suffix <tt>in:</tt> thus, <tt>paripant\u00edn</tt> ''besetting the path''.\n\nd. The prepositional compounds are especially liable to adverbial use: see below, 1313 b.\n\n<center>Adjective Compounds as Nouns and as Adverbs.</center>\n\n1311. Compound adjectives, like simple ones, are freely used substantively as abstracts and collectives, especially in the neuter, less often in the feminine; and they are also much used adverbially, especially in the accusative neuter.\n\na. The matter is entitled to special notice only because certain forms of combination have become of special frequency in these uses, and because the Hindu grammarians have made out of them distinct classes of compounds, with separate names. There is nothing in the older language which by its own merits would call for particular remark under this head.\n\n1312. The substantively used compounds having a numeral as prior member, along with, in part, the adjective compounds themselves, are treated by the Hindus as a separate class, called <tt>dvigu</tt>.\n\na. The name is a sample of the class, and means ''of two cows'', said to be used in the sense of ''worth two cows;'' as also <tt>pa\u00f1cagu</tt> ''bought for five cows'', <tt>dvin\u0101u</tt> ''worth two ships'', <tt>p\u00e1\u00f1cakap\u0101la</tt> ''made in five cups'', and so on.\n\nb. Vedic examples of numeral abstracts and collectives are: <tt>dvir\u0101j\u00e1</tt> ''[combat] of two kings'', <tt>triyug\u00e1</tt> ''three ages'', <tt>triyojan\u00e1</tt> ''space of three leagues'', <tt>tridiv\u00e1</tt> ''the triple heaven'', <tt>pa\u00f1cayojan\u00e1</tt> ''space of five leagues'', <tt>\u1e63a\u1e0dah\u00e1</tt> ''six days' time'', <tt>da\u00e7\u0101n\u0304gul\u00e1</tt> ''ten fingers' breadth;'' and, with suffix <tt>ya</tt>, <tt>sahasr\u0101h\u1e47y\u00e1</tt> ''thousand days' journey''. Others, not numeral, but essentially of the same character, are, for example: <tt>anamitr\u00e1</tt> ''freedom from enemies'', <tt>nikilbi\u1e63\u00e1</tt> ''freedom from guilt'', <tt>savidyut\u00e1</tt> ''thunderstorm'', <tt>v\u00edh\u1e5bdaya</tt> ''heartlessness'', and<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"415492":{"pageid":415492,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/539","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>''the Brahman that broke the pots'', <tt>ukh\u0101n\u1e5btam \u1e5b\u1e63i\u1e41 yath\u0101</tt> ''like a sage that has spoken falsely''.\n\n<center>B. Compounds with Governed Final Member.</center> \n\n1309. Participial Compounds. This group of compounds, in which the prior member is a present participle and the final member its object, is a small one (toward thirty examples), and exclusively Vedic \u2014 indeed, almost limited to the oldest Vedic (of the Rig-Veda). The accent is on the final syllable of the participle, whatever may have been the latter's accent as an independent word.\n\na. Examples are: <tt>vid\u00e1dvasu</tt> ''winning good things'', <tt>k\u1e63ay\u00e1dv\u012bra</tt> ''governing'' (<tt>k\u1e63\u00e1yant</tt>) ''heroes'', <tt>tar\u00e1ddvevas</tt> ''overcoming'' (<tt>t\u00e1rant</tt>) ''foes'', <tt>\u0101bhar\u00e1dvasu</tt> ''bringing good things'', <tt>coday\u00e1nmati</tt> ''inciting'' (<tt>cod\u00e1yant</tt>) ''devotion'', <tt>manday\u00e1tsakha</tt> ''rejoicing friends'', <tt>dh\u0101ray\u00e1tkavi</tt> ''sustaining sages'', <tt>ma\u1e45hay\u00e1drayi</tt> ''bestowing wealth''.\n\nb. In <tt>s\u0101d\u00e1dyoni</tt> ''sitting in the lap'' (<tt>s\u0101dat</tt> quite anomalously for <tt>s\u012bdat</tt> or <tt>sadat</tt>), and <tt>sp\u1e5bhay\u00e1dvar\u1e47a</tt> ''emulous of color'', the case-relation of the final member is other than accusative. In <tt>patay\u00e1n manday\u00e1tsakham</tt> (RV. i. 4. 7), <tt>patay\u00e1t</tt>, with accent changed accordingly, represents <tt>patay\u00e1tsakham</tt>, the final member being understood from the following word. <tt>Vid\u00e1da\u00e7va</tt> is to be inferred from its derivative v\u0101\u00eddada\u00e7vi. Of this formation appear to be <tt>jam\u00e1dagni, prat\u00e1dvasu</tt> (<tt>prath\u00e1d</tt>?), and <tt>tras\u00e1dasyu</tt> (for <tt>tras\u00e1ddasyu</tt>?). It was noticed above (1299 c) that <tt>yuyuj\u0101n\u00e1sapti</tt> is capable of being understood as a unique compound of like character, with a perfect instead of present participle; <tt>s\u0101\u0301dhadi\u1e63\u1e6di</tt>, on account of its accent, is probably possessive.\n\n1310. Prepositional Compounds. By this name may be conveniently called those combinations in which the prior member is a particle having true prepositional value, and the final member is a noun governed by it. Such combinations, though few in number as compared with other classes of compounds, are not rare, either in the earlier language or in the later. Their accent is so various that no rule can be set up respecting it.\n\na. Examples are: <tt>\u00e1tyavi</tt> ''passing through the wool'', <tt>atir\u0101tr\u00e1</tt> ''overnight'', <tt>atim\u0101tr\u00e1</tt> ''exceeding measure;'' <tt>\u00e1dhiratha</tt> ''lying on the chariot'', <tt>adhigav\u00e1</tt> ''belonging to the cow;'' <tt>adhaspad\u00e1</tt> ''under the feet'', <tt>adhoak\u1e63a</tt> ''below the axle;'' <tt>\u00e1nupatha</tt> ''following the road'', <tt>anup\u016brv\u00e1</tt> ''following the one preceding, one after another'', <tt>anu\u1e63aty\u00e1</tt> ''in accordance with truth'', <tt>anuk\u016b\u0301la</tt> ''down stream'', etc.; <tt>\u00e1ntaspatha</tt> (with anomalously changed accent of <tt>ant\u00e1r</tt>), ''within the way'', <tt>antard\u0101v\u00e1</tt> ''within the flame (?)'', <tt>antarhast\u00e1</tt> ''in the hand;'' <tt>\u00e1ntig\u1e5bha</tt> ''near the house;'' <tt>apipr\u0101\u0301\u1e47a</tt> ''accompanying the breath'' (<tt>pr\u0101\u1e47\u00e1</tt>), <tt>\u00e1pivrata</tt> ''concerned with the ceremony'', <tt>api\u00e7arvar\u00e1</tt> ''bordering on night'', <tt>apikar\u1e47\u00e1</tt> ''next the ear;'' <tt>abhij\u00f1\u00fa</tt> ''reaching to the knee'', <tt>abh\u00edv\u012bra</tt> and <tt>abh\u00edsatvan</tt> ''overcoming heroes;'' <tt>\u0101\u0301pathi</tt> ''on the road'', <tt>\u0101\u0301deva</tt> ''going to the gods'', <tt>\u0101jaras\u00e1</tt><noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"415494":{"pageid":415494,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/528","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\n2. e. The prefixes <tt>su</tt> and <tt>dus</tt> have this tendency in a much less degree, and their compounds are very variously accented, now on the prefix, now on the final syllable, now on the accented syllable of the final member; and occasionally on either of two syllables.\n\nf. Thus, for example, <tt>s\u00fabhadra, s\u00favipra, s\u00fapakva, s\u00fabr\u0101hma\u1e47a, s\u00fabhi\u1e63aj</tt>; <tt>sut\u012brth\u00e1, suvasan\u00e1, su\u1e63\u0101rath\u00ed, sup\u0101\u00e7\u00e1, sucitr\u00e1</tt>; <tt>su\u00e7\u00e9va, suh\u00f3t\u1e5b</tt>: <tt>suv\u012b\u0301ra</tt> is like <tt>av\u012b\u0301ra</tt>; \u2014 <tt>durmitr\u00e1, du\u1e63v\u00e1pnya</tt>; and <tt>ducch\u00fan\u0101</tt> (168 b), with irregular retraction of accent (<tt>\u00e7un\u00e1</tt>).\n\n3. g. The compounds with <tt>sa</tt> are too few to furnish occasion for separate mention; and those with the interrogative prefix in its various forms are also extremely rare in the Veda: examples are <tt>kucar\u00e1, katpay\u00e1, k\u00e1bandha, kunannam\u00e1, kum\u0101r\u00e1, k\u00fayava, ku\u1e63\u00e1va</tt>.\n\n1289. The verbal prefixes are sometimes used in a general adverbial way, qualifying a following adjective or noun.\n\na. Examples of such combinations are not numerous in the Veda. Their accentuation is various, though the tone rests oftenest on the preposition. Thus, <tt>\u00e1dhipati</tt> ''over-lord'', <tt>\u00e1par\u016bpa</tt> ''mis-form'', <tt>pr\u00e1ti\u00e7atru</tt> ''opposing foe'', <tt>pr\u00e1pada</tt> ''fore part of foot'', <tt>pr\u00e1\u1e47ap\u0101t</tt> ''great-grandchild'', <tt>v\u00edpakva</tt> ''quite done'', <tt>s\u00e1mpriya</tt> ''mutually dear;'' <tt>upaj\u00edhvik\u0101</tt> ''side tongue'' (with retraction of the accent of <tt>jihv\u0101\u0301</tt>); <tt>antarde\u00e7\u00e1</tt> ''intermediate direction'', <tt>prad\u00edv</tt> ''forward heaven'', <tt>prapit\u0101mah\u00e1</tt> (also <tt>pr\u00e1pit\u0101maha</tt>) ''great-grandfather'', <tt>pratijan\u00e1</tt> ''opponent'', <tt>vyadhv\u00e1</tt> ''midway''. These compounds are more frequent with possessive value (below, 1305).\n\nb. This use of the verbal prefixes is more common later, and some of them have a regular value in such compounds. Thus, <tt>ati</tt> denotes excess, as in <tt>atid\u016bra</tt> ''very far'', <tt>atibhaya</tt> ''exceeding fear'', <tt>\u00e1tip\u016bru\u1e63a</tt> (\u00c7B.) ''chief man;'' <tt>adhi</tt>, superiority, as in <tt>adhidanta</tt> ''upper-tooth'', <tt>adhistr\u012b</tt> ''chief woman;'' <tt>abhi</tt> is intensive, as in <tt>abhinamra</tt> ''much incliving'', <tt>abhinava</tt> ''span-new'', <tt>abhirucira</tt> ''delightful;'' <tt>\u0101</tt> signifies ''somewhat'', as in <tt>\u0101ku\u1e6dila</tt> ''somewhat crooked'', <tt>\u0101n\u012bla</tt> ''bluish;'' <tt>upa</tt> denotes something accessory or secondary, as in <tt>upapur\u0101\u1e47a</tt> ''additional Pur\u0101na;'' <tt>pari</tt>, excess, as in <tt>paridurbala</tt> ''very weak;'' <tt>prati</tt>, opposition, as in <tt>pratipak\u1e63a</tt> ''opposing side'', <tt>pratipustaka</tt> ''copy;'' <tt>vi</tt>, variation or excess, as in <tt>vid\u016bra</tt> ''very far'', <tt>vip\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du</tt> ''greyish'', <tt>vik\u1e63udra</tt> ''respectively small;'' <tt>sam</tt>, completeness, as in <tt>sampakva</tt> ''quite ripe''.\n\n1290. Other compounds with adverbial prior members are quite irregularly accented.\n\nThus, the compounds with <tt>puru</tt>, on the final (compare the participles with <tt>puru</tt>, 1284 b): as, <tt>purudasm\u00e1</tt>, <tt>purupriy\u00e1</tt>, <tt>puru\u00e7candr\u00e1</tt>; those with <tt>p\u00fanar</tt>, on the prior member, as <tt>p\u00fanar\u1e47ava, p\u00fanarmagha, p\u00fanaryuvan, p\u00fanarvasu</tt> (but <tt>puna\u1e25sar\u00e1</tt> etc.); those with <tt>sat\u00e1s, sat\u012bn\u00e1, saty\u00e1</tt>, the same, as <tt>sat\u00f3mahant, sat\u012bn\u00e1manyu, saty\u00e1mugra</tt>; a few combinations of nouns in <tt>t\u1e5b</tt> and <tt>ana</tt> with adverbs akin with the prefixes, on the final syllable, as <tt>pura\u00ebt\u1e5b\u0301, pura\u1e25sth\u0101t\u1e5b\u0301, upari\u00e7ayan\u00e1, pr\u0101ta\u1e25savan\u00e1</tt>; and miscellaneous cases are <tt>mith\u00f3avadyapa, h\u00e1ri\u00e7candra, \u00e1lpa\u00e7ayu, s\u0101dhvary\u00e1, y\u0101cchre\u1e63\u1e6dh\u00e1</tt> and <tt>y\u0101vacchre\u1e63\u1e6dh\u00e1, jy\u00f3g\u0101may\u0101vin</tt>.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"415497":{"pageid":415497,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/530","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>possessive <tt>s\u016b\u0301ryatejas</tt> ''possessing the brightness of the sun;'' <tt>yaj\u00f1ak\u0101m\u00e1</tt> ''desire of sacrifice'' becomes <tt>yaj\u00f1\u00e1k\u0101ma</tt> ''having desire of sacrifice;'' the descriptive <tt>b\u1e5bhadratha</tt> ''great chariot'' becomes the possessive <tt>b\u1e5bh\u00e1dratha</tt> ''having great chariots;'' <tt>\u00e1hasta</tt> ''not hand'' becomes <tt>ahast\u00e1</tt> ''handless;'' <tt>durgandhi</tt> ''ill savor'' becomes <tt>durg\u00e1ndhi</tt> ''of ill savor;'' and so on.\n\nb. A copulative compound is not convertible into an adjective directly, any more than is a simple noun, but requires, like the latter, a possessive suffix or other means: e. g. <tt>v\u0101gghastavant, do\u1e63agu\u1e47in, rajastamaska, a\u00e7irogr\u012bva, an\u1e5bgyajus</tt>. A very small number of exceptions, however, are found: thus, <tt>somendr\u00e1</tt> (TS.), <tt>st\u00f3map\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> (VS. TS.), <tt>hasty\u1e5b\u0300\u1e63abha</tt> (\u00c7B.), <tt>d\u0101s\u012bni\u1e63ka</tt> (ChU.), and, later, <tt>cakramusala, sad\u0101nanda, saccid\u0101nanda, s\u0101n\u0304khyayoga</tt> (as n. pr.), <tt>bal\u0101bala, bh\u016btabh\u0101utika</tt>.\n\nc. The name given by the native grammarians to the possessive compounds is <tt>bahuvr\u012bhi</tt>: the word is an example of the class, meaning ''possessing much rice''.\n\nd. The name \"relative\", instead of possessive, sometimes applied to this class, is an utter misnomer; since, though the meaning of such a compound (as of any attributive word) is easily cast into a relative form, its essential character lies in the possessive verb which has nevertheless to be added, or in the possessive case of the relative which must be used: thus, <tt>mah\u0101kavi</tt> and <tt>\u0101yurd\u0101</tt>, descriptive and dependent, are \"relative\" also, ''who is a great poet'', and ''that is life-giving'', but <tt>b\u1e5bhadratha</tt>, possessive, means ''who has a great chariot'', or ''whose is a great chariot''.\n\n1294. a. That a noun, simple or compound, should be added to another noun, in an appositive way, with a value virtually attributive, and that such nouns should occasionally gain by frequent association and application an adjective form also, is natural enough, and occurs in many languages; the peculiarity of the Sanskrit formation lies in two things. First, that such use should have become a perfectly regular and indefinitely extensible one in the case of compounded words, so that any compound with noun-final may be turned without alteration into an adjective, while to a simple noun must be added an adjective-making suffix in order to adapt it to adjective use: for example, that while <tt>hasta</tt> must become <tt>hastin</tt> and <tt>b\u0101hu</tt> must become <tt>b\u0101humant</tt>, <tt>hira\u1e47yahasta</tt> and <tt>mah\u0101b\u0101hu</tt> change from noun to adjective value with no added ending. And second, that the relation of the qualified noun to the compound should have come to be so generally that of possession, not of likeness, nor of appurtenance, nor of any other relation which is as naturally involved in such a construction: that we may only say, for example, <tt>mah\u0101b\u0101hu\u1e25 puru\u1e63a\u1e25</tt> ''man with great arms'', and not also <tt>mah\u0101b\u0101hur ma\u1e47i\u1e25</tt> ''jewel for a great arm'', or <tt>mah\u0101b\u0101hava\u1e25 \u00e7\u0101kh\u0101\u1e25</tt> ''branches like great arms''.\n\nb. There are, however, in the older language a few derivative adjective compounds which imply the relation of appurtenance rather than that of possession, and which are with probability to be viewed as survivals of a state of things antecedent to the specialization of the general class as<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"415498":{"pageid":415498,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/531","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>possessive (compare the similar exceptions under possessive suffixes, 1230 g, 1233 f).

And the compounds with final member in <tt>ana</tt> mentioned at 1296 b are probably of the same character. But also in the later language, some of the so-called <tt>dvigu</tt>-compounds (1312) belong with these: so <tt>dvigu</tt> itself, as meaning ''worth two cows'', <tt>dvin\u0101u</tt> ''bought for two ships;'' also occasional cases like <tt>dev\u0101sura [sa\u1e41gr\u0101ma]</tt> ''of the gods and demons'', <tt>narahaya</tt> ''of man and horse'', <tt>cakramusala</tt> ''with discus and club'', <tt>gurutalpa</tt> ''violating the teacher's bed''.\n\n1295. The possessive compound is distinguished from its substrate, the determinative, generally by a difference of accent. This difference is not of the same nature in all the divisions of the class; but oftenest, the possessive has as a compound the natural accent of its prior member (as in most of the examples given above).\n\n1296. Possessively used dependent compounds, or possessive dependents, are very much less common than those corresponding to the other division of determinatives.\n\na. Further examples are: <tt>may\u016b\u0301raroman</tt> ''having the plumes of peacocks'', <tt>agn\u00edtejas</tt> ''having the brightness of fire'', <tt>j\u00f1at\u00edmukha</tt> ''wearing the aspect of relatives'', <tt>p\u00e1tik\u0101ma</tt> ''desiring a husband'', <tt>hastip\u0101da</tt> ''having an elephant's feet'', <tt>r\u0101jany\u00e0bandhu</tt> ''having kshatriyas for relatives''.\n\nb. The accent is, as in the examples given, regularly that of the prior member, and exceptions are rare and of doubtful character. A few compounds with derivatives in <tt>ana</tt> have the accent of the final member: e. g. <tt>indrap\u0101\u0301na</tt> ''serving as drink for Indra'', <tt>devas\u00e1dana</tt> ''serving as seat for the gods'', <tt>rayisth\u0101\u0301na</tt> ''being source of wealth;'' but they contain no implication of possession, and are possibly in character, as in accent, dependent (but compare 1294 b). Also a few in <tt>as</tt>, as <tt>n\u1e5bc\u00e1k\u1e63as</tt> ''men-beholding'', <tt>n\u1e5bv\u0101\u0301has</tt> ''men-bearing'', <tt>k\u1e63etras\u0101\u0301dhas</tt> ''field-prospering'', are probably to be judged in the same way.\n\n1297. Possessively used descriptive compounds, or possessive descriptives, are extremely numerous and of every variety of character; and some kinds of combination which are rare in proper descriptive use are very common as possessives.\n\na.

Possessive compounds in which a noun is preceded by a qualifying ordinary adjective are (as pointed out above, 1280 f) very much more common than descriptives of the same form.\n\na. They regularly and usually have the accent of their prior member: thus, <tt>any\u00e1r\u016bpa</tt> ''of other form'', <tt>ugr\u00e1b\u0101hu</tt> ''having powerful arms'', <tt>j\u012bv\u00e1putra</tt> ''having living sons'', <tt>d\u012brgh\u00e1\u00e7ma\u00e7ru</tt> ''longbearded'', <tt>b\u1e5bh\u00e1cchravas</tt> ''of great renown'', <tt>bh\u016b\u0301rim\u016bla</tt> ''many-rooted'', <tt>mah\u0101\u0301vadha</tt> ''bearing a great weapon'', <tt>vi\u00e7v\u00e1r\u016bpa</tt> ''having all forms'', <tt>\u00e7ukr\u00e1var\u1e47a</tt> ''of bright color'', <tt>\u00e7iv\u0101\u0301bhimar\u00e7ana</tt> ''of propitious touch'', <tt>saty\u00e1sa\u1e41dha</tt> ''of true promises'', <tt>s\u00e1rv\u0101n\u0304ga</tt> ''whole-limbed'', <tt>sv\u00e1ya\u00e7as</tt> ''having own glory'', <tt>h\u00e1ritasraj</tt> ''wearing yellow garlands''.\n\nb. Exceptions, however, in regard to accent are not rare (a seventh or eighth of the whole number, perhaps). Thus, the accent is sometimes that of the final member; especially with derivatives in as, as <tt>tuvir\u0101\u0301dhas, purup\u00e9\u00e7as, p\u1e5bthup\u00e1k\u1e63as</tt>, and others in which (as above, 1296 b) a determinative character may be suspected: thus, <tt>urujr\u00e1yas</tt> beside <tt>urujr\u00ed</tt>, <tt>uruvy\u00e1cas</tt> beside <tt>uruvy\u00e1c</tt>, and so on; but also with those of other final, as <tt>\u1e5bjuh\u00e1sta, \u00e7itik\u00e1k\u1e63a</tt> etc., <tt>k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ak\u00e1r\u1e47a, citrad\u1e5b\u0301\u00e7ika, tuvi\u00e7\u00fa\u1e63ma, \u1e5bjukr\u00e1tu, p\u1e5bthup\u00e1r\u00e7u, puruv\u00e1rtman, raghuy\u0101\u0301man, v\u012b\u1e0dup\u00e1tman</tt>. In a very few cases, the accent is retracted from the final to the first syllable of the second member: thus, <tt>a\u1e45hubh\u00e9da, tuvigr\u012b\u0301va, puruv\u012b\u0301ra, purur\u016b\u0301pa, \u00e7itib\u0101\u0301hu</tt> (also <tt>\u00e7itib\u0101h\u00fa</tt>). The largest class is that of compounds which take the accent upon their final syllable (in part, of course, not distinguishable from those which retain the accent of the final member): for example, <tt>bahvann\u00e1, n\u012blanakh\u00e1, puruputr\u00e1, vi\u00e7v\u0101n\u0304g\u00e1, svapat\u00ed, tuviprat\u00ed, p\u1e5b\u00e7iparn\u012b\u0301</tt> f., <tt>dar\u00e7ata\u00e7r\u012b\u0301, p\u016btirajj\u00fa, asitaj\u00f1\u00fa, p\u1e5bthugm\u00e1n, bahupraj\u00e1s</tt>.\n\nc. The adjective <tt>v\u00ed\u00e7va</tt> ''all'', as prior member of a compound (and also in derivation), changes its accent regularly to <tt>vi\u00e7v\u00e1</tt>; <tt>s\u00e1rva</tt> ''whole, all'' does the same in a few cases.\n\n1299. Possessive compounds with a participle preceding and qualifying the final noun-member are numerous, although such a compound with simple descriptive value is almost unknown. The accent is, with few exceptions, that of the prior member.\n\na. The participle is oftenest the passive one, in <tt>ta</tt> or <tt>na</tt>. Thus, <tt>chinn\u00e1pak\u1e63a</tt> ''with severed wing'', <tt>dh\u1e5bt\u00e1r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra</tt> ''of firmly held royalty'', <tt>hat\u00e1m\u0101t\u1e5b</tt> ''whose mother is slain'', <tt>iddh\u0101\u0301gni</tt> ''whose fire is kindled'', <tt>utt\u0101n\u00e1hasta</tt> ''with outstretched hand'', <tt>pr\u00e1yatadak\u1e63i\u1e47a</tt> ''having presented sacrificial gifts;'' and, with prefixed negative, <tt>\u00e1ri\u1e63\u1e6dav\u012bra</tt> ''whose men are unharmed'', <tt>\u00e1taptatanu</tt> ''of unburned substance'', <tt>\u00e1nabhiml\u0101tavar\u1e47a</tt> ''of untarnished color''. Exceptions in regard to accent are very few: there have been noticed only <tt>paryast\u0101k\u1e63\u00e1, vyastake\u00e7\u012b\u0301</tt> f., <tt>achinnapar\u1e47\u00e1</tt>.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"415502":{"pageid":415502,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/533","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\nb. Examples occur of a present participle in the same situation. In about half the (accentuated) instances, it gives its own accent to the compound: thus, <tt>dyut\u00e1dy\u0101man, dh\u1e5b\u1e63\u00e1dvar\u1e47a</tt> etc., <tt>\u00e7uc\u00e1dratha, r\u00fa\u00e7advatsa</tt> etc., <tt>bhr\u0101\u0301jajjanman</tt> etc., <tt>sa\u1e41y\u00e1dv\u012bra, stan\u00e1yadama, s\u0101\u0301dhadi\u1e63\u1e6di</tt>; in the others, the accent is drawn forward to the final syllable of the participle (as in the compounds with governing participle: below, 1309): thus, <tt>drav\u00e1tp\u0101\u1e47i</tt> etc. (<tt>drav\u00e1t</tt> also occurs as adverb), <tt>rap\u00e7\u00e1d\u016bdhan, svan\u00e1dratha, arc\u00e1ddh\u016bma, bhand\u00e1di\u1e63\u1e6di, krand\u00e1di\u1e63\u1e6di</tt>. With these last agrees in form <tt>jar\u00e1da\u1e63\u1e6di</tt> ''attaining old age, long-lived;'' but its make-up, in view of its meaning, is anomalous.\n\nc. The RV. has two compounds with the perfect middle participle as prior member: thus, <tt>yuyuj\u0101n\u00e1sapti</tt> ''with harnessed coursers'' (perhaps rather ''having harnessed their coursers''), and <tt>dad\u1e5b\u00e7\u0101n\u00e1pavi</tt> (with regular accent, instead of <tt>d\u00e1d\u1e5b\u00e7\u0101na</tt>, as elsewhere irregularly in this participle) ''with conspicuous wheel-rims''.\n\nd. Of a nearly participial character is the prior element in <tt>\u00e7r\u00fatkar\u1e47a</tt> (RV.) ''of listening ear;'' and with this are perhaps accordant <tt>d\u012b\u0301dyagni</tt> and <tt>sth\u0101\u0301ra\u00e7man</tt> (RV., each once).\n\n1300. Possessive compounds having a numeral as prior member are very common, and for the most part follow the same rule of accent which is followed by compounds with other adjectives: excepted are those beginning with <tt>dvi</tt> and <tt>tri</tt>, which accent in general the final member.\n\na. Examples with other numerals than <tt>dvi</tt> and <tt>tri</tt> are: <tt>\u00e9kacakra, \u00e9ka\u00e7\u012br\u1e63an, \u00e9kapad, c\u00e1turan\u0304ga, c\u00e1tu\u1e63pak\u1e63a, p\u00e1n\u0304c\u0101n\u0304guri, p\u00e1n\u0304c\u0101udana, \u1e63\u00e1\u1e0da\u00e7va, \u1e63\u00e1\u1e6dpad, sapt\u00e1jihva, sapt\u00e1m\u0101t\u1e5b, a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u0301pad, a\u1e63\u1e6d\u00e1putra, n\u00e1vapad, n\u00e1vadv\u0101ra, d\u00e1\u00e7a\u00e7\u0101kha, d\u00e1\u00e7a\u00e7\u012br\u1e63an, dv\u0101\u0301da\u00e7\u0101ra, tri\u1e45\u00e7\u00e1dara, \u00e7at\u00e1parvan, \u00e7at\u00e1dant, sah\u00e1sra\u1e47\u0101man, sah\u00e1sram\u016bla</tt>.\n\nb. Exceptions in regard to accent are but few, and have the tone on the final syllable, whatever may be that belonging originally to the final member; they are mostly stems in final <tt>a</tt>, used by substitution for others in <tt>an</tt>, <tt>i</tt>, or a consonant: thus, <tt>caturak\u1e63\u00e1</tt> etc. (<tt>ak\u1e63\u00e1n</tt> or <tt>\u00e1k\u1e63i</tt>: 431), <tt>\u1e63a\u1e0dah\u00e1</tt> etc. (<tt>\u00e1han</tt> or <tt>\u00e1har</tt>: 430 a), <tt>da\u00e7av\u1e5b\u1e63\u00e1</tt> etc. (<tt>v\u1e5b\u0301\u1e63an</tt>), <tt>ekar\u0101tr\u00e1</tt> etc. (<tt>r\u0101\u0301tri</tt> or <tt>r\u0101\u0301tr\u012b</tt>), <tt>ekarc\u00e1</tt> etc. (<tt>\u1e5b\u0301c</tt>); but also a few others, as <tt>\u1e63a\u1e0dyog\u00e1, a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101yog\u00e1, \u00e7at\u0101rgh\u00e1, sahasr\u0101rgh\u00e1, ekapar\u00e1</tt> (?).\n\nc. The compounds with <tt>dvi</tt> and <tt>tri</tt> for the most part have the accent of their final member: thus, for example, <tt>dvij\u00e1nman, dvidh\u0101\u0301ra, dvib\u00e1ndhu, dvivartan\u00ed, dvip\u00e1d</tt>; <tt>trit\u00e1ntu, trin\u0101\u0301bhi, tri\u00e7\u00f3ka, triv\u00e1r\u016btha, tricakr\u00e1, tri\u00e7\u012br\u1e63\u00e1n, trip\u00e1d</tt>. A number of words, however, follow the general analogy, and accent the numeral: thus, for example, <tt>dv\u00edpak\u1e63a, dv\u00ed\u00e7avas, dvy\u0101\u0300sya, tr\u00ed\u1e63andhi, try\u00e0ra, try\u0101\u0300\u00e7ir</tt>, and sometimes <tt>dv\u00edpad</tt> and <tt>tr\u00edpad</tt> in AV. As in the other numeral compounds, a substituted stem in <tt>a</tt> is apt to take the accent on the final: thus, <tt>dviv\u1e5b\u1e63\u00e1</tt> and <tt>triv\u1e5b\u1e63\u00e1</tt>, <tt>dvir\u0101j\u00e1, dvir\u0101tr\u00e1, try\u0101yu\u1e63\u00e1, tridiv\u00e1</tt>; and a few of other<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"415503":{"pageid":415503,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/534","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>character with <tt>tri</tt> follow the same rule: thus, <tt>trika\u00e7\u00e1, trin\u0101k\u00e1, tribandh\u00fa, tryudh\u00e1n, tribarh\u00eds</tt>, etc.\n\nd. The neuter, or also the feminine, of numeral compounds is often used substantively, with a collective or abstract value, and the accent is then regularly on the final syllable: see below, 1312.\n\n1301. Possessive compounds having as prior member a noun which has a quasi-adjective value in qualifying the final member are very frequent, and show certain specialities of usage.\n\na. Least peculiar is a noun of material as prior member (hardly to be reckoned as possessive dependents, because the relation of material is not regularly expressed by a case: 295): thus, <tt>h\u00edra\u1e47yahasta</tt> ''gold-handed'', <tt>h\u00edra\u1e47yasraj</tt> ''with golden garlands'', <tt>\u00e1ya\u1e25sth\u016b\u1e47a</tt> ''having brazen supports'', <tt>rajat\u00e1n\u0101bhi</tt> ''of silver navel''.\n\n1302. Especially common is the use of a noun as prior member to qualify the other appositionally, or by way of equivalence (the occasional occurrence of determinatives of this character has been noticed above, 1280 d). These may conveniently be called appositional possessives. Their accent is that of the prior member, like the ordinary possessive descriptives.\n\na. Examples are: <tt>\u00e1\u00e7vapar\u1e47a</tt> ''horse-winged'', or ''having horses as wings'' (said of a chariot), <tt>bh\u016b\u0301mig\u1e5bha</tt> ''having the earth as house'', <tt>\u00edndrasakhi</tt> ''having Indra for friend'', <tt>agn\u00edhot\u1e5b</tt> ''having Agni as priest'', <tt>gandharv\u00e1patn\u012b</tt> ''having a Gandharva for spouse'', <tt>\u00e7\u016br\u00e1putra</tt> ''having hero-sons'', <tt>jar\u0101\u0301m\u1e5btyu</tt> ''having old age as mode of death, living till old age'', <tt>agn\u00edv\u0101sas</tt> ''fire-clad'', <tt>tadanta</tt> ''ending with that'', <tt>c\u0101racak\u1e63us</tt> ''using spies for eyes'', <tt>v\u00ed\u1e63\u1e47u\u00e7arman\u0101man</tt> ''named Vishnu\u00e7arman;'' and, with pronoun instead of noun, <tt>tv\u0101\u0301d\u016bta</tt> ''having thee as messenger'', <tt>t\u00e1dapas</tt> ''having this for work''. Exceptions in regard to accent occur here, as in the more regular descriptive formation: thus, <tt>agnijihv\u00e1, v\u1e5b\u1e63a\u1e47a\u00e7v\u00e1, dh\u016bma\u00e7ikh\u00e1, pav\u012bnas\u00e1, as\u00e1un\u0101\u0301ma, tatk\u00fala</tt>, etc.\n\nb. Not infrequently, a substantively used adjective is the final member in such a compound: thus, <tt>\u00edndrajye\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> ''having Indra as chief'', <tt>m\u00e1na\u1e25\u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> ''having the mind as sixth'', <tt>s\u00f3ma\u00e7re\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> ''of which soma is best'', <tt>ekapar\u00e1</tt> ''of which the ace is highest'' (?), <tt>\u00e1sthibh\u016byas</tt> ''having bone as the larger part, chiefly of bone'', <tt>abhir\u016bpabh\u016byi\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> ''chiefly composed of worthy persons'', <tt>da\u00e7\u0101vara</tt> ''having ten as the lowest number'', <tt>cint\u0101para</tt> ''having meditation as highest object or occupation, devoted to meditation'', <tt>ni\u1e25\u00e7v\u0101saparama</tt> ''much addicted to sighing''.\n\nc. Certain words are of especial frequency in the compounds here described, and have in part won a peculiar application. Thus:\n\nd. With <tt>\u0101di</tt> ''beginning'' or <tt>\u0101dika</tt> or <tt>\u0101dya</tt> ''first'' are made compounds signifying the person or thing specified along with others, such a person or thing ''et cetera''. For example, <tt>dev\u0101 indr\u0101daya\u1e25</tt> ''the gods having Indra as first'', i. e. ''the gods Indra etc.'', <tt>mar\u012bcy\u0101d\u012bn mun\u012bn</tt> ''Mar\u012bci and the other''<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"415504":{"pageid":415504,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/535","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>''sages'', <tt>sv\u0101yambhuv\u0101dy\u0101\u1e25 sapt\u0101i \u2019te manava\u1e25</tt> ''those seven Manus, Sv\u0101yambhuva etc.'', <tt>agni\u1e63\u1e6dom\u0101dik\u0101n</tt> ''the sacrifices Agnishtoma and so on''.

The particles <tt>evam</tt> and <tt>iti</tt> are also sometimes used by substitution as prior members: thus, <tt>evam\u0101di vacanam</tt> ''words to this and the like effect;'' <tt>ato \u2018ham brav\u012bmi kartavya\u1e25 sa\u1e41cayo nityam ity\u0101di</tt> ''hence I say \"accumulation is ever to be made\" etc''.\n\ne.

Words meaning ''foregoer, predecessor'', and the like \u2014 namely, <tt>p\u016brva, p\u016brvaka, pura\u1e25sara, purask\u1e5bta, purogama</tt> \u2014 are often employed in a similar manner, and especially adverbially, but for the most part to denote accompaniment, rather than antecedence, of that which is designated by the prior member of the compound: e. g. <tt>smitap\u016brvam</tt> ''with a smile'', <tt>an\u0101mayapra\u00e7nap\u016brvakam</tt> ''with inquiries after health'', <tt>pit\u0101mahapurogama</tt> ''accompanied by the Great Father''.\n\ng. The noun <tt>m\u0101tr\u0101</tt> ''measure'' stands as final of a compound which is used adjectively or in the substantive neuter to signify a limit that is not exceeded, and obtains thus the virtual value of ''mere, only:'' thus, <tt>jalam\u0101tre\u1e47a vartayan</tt> ''living by water only'' (lit. ''by that which has water for its measure'' or ''limit''), <tt>garbhacyutim\u0101tre\u1e47a</tt> ''by merely issuing from the womb'', <tt>pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101trikam\u0101tra\u1e25 sy\u0101t</tt> ''let him be one possessing what does not exceed the preservation of life;'' <tt>uktam\u0101tre tu vacane</tt> ''but the words being merely uttered''.\n\nh. The noun <tt>artha</tt> ''object, purpose'' is used at the end of a compound, in the adverbial accusative neuter, to signify ''for the take of'' or the like: thus, <tt>yaj\u00f1asiddhyartham</tt> ''in order to the accomplishment of the sacrifice'' (lit. ''in a manner having the accomplishment of the sacrifice as its object''), <tt>damayantyartham</tt> ''for Damayant\u012b's sake'' (''with Damayant\u012b as object'').\n\ni. Other examples are <tt>\u0101bh\u0101, kalpa</tt>, in the sense of ''like, approaching:'' thus, <tt>hem\u0101bha</tt> ''gold-like'', m\u1e5btakalpa ''nearly dead'', <tt>pratipannakalpa</tt> ''almost accomplished;'' \u2014 <tt>vidh\u0101</tt>, in the sense of ''kind, sort:'' thus, <tt>tvadvidha</tt> ''of thy sort'', <tt>p\u00faru\u1e63avidha</tt> ''of human kind;'' \u2014 <tt>pr\u0101ya</tt>, in the sense of ''mostly, often'', and the like: thus, <tt>du\u1e25khapr\u0101ya</tt> ''full of pain'', <tt>t\u1e5b\u1e47apr\u0101ya</tt> ''abounding in grass'', <tt>nirgamanapr\u0101ya</tt> ''often going out;'' \u2014 <tt>antara</tt> (in substantive neuter), in the sense of ''other:'' thus, <tt>de\u00e7\u0101ntara</tt> ''another region'' (lit.

In the later language, such compounds are not infrequent with words meaning ''hand:'' thus, <tt>\u00e7astrap\u0101\u1e47i</tt> ''having a sword in the hand'', <tt>lagu\u1e0dahasta</tt> ''carrying a staff''.\n\n1304. Of possessive compounds having an adverbial element as prior member, the most numerous by far are those made with the inseparable prefixes. Their accent is various. Thus:\n\na. In compounds with the negative prefix <tt>a</tt> or <tt>an</tt> (in which the latter logically negatives the imported idea of possession), the accent is prevailingly on the final syllable, without regard to the original accent of the final member. For example: <tt>anant\u00e1</tt> ''having no end'', <tt>abal\u00e1</tt> ''not possessing strength'', <tt>arath\u00e1</tt> ''without chariot'', <tt>a\u00e7raddh\u00e1</tt> ''faithless'', <tt>ama\u1e47\u00ed</tt> ''without ornament'', <tt>a\u00e7atr\u00fa</tt> ''without a foe'', <tt>avarm\u00e1n</tt> ''not cuirassed'', <tt>ad\u00e1nt</tt> ''toothless'', <tt>ap\u00e1d</tt> ''footless'', <tt>atej\u00e1s</tt> ''without brightness'', an\u0101rambha\u1e47\u00e1 ''not to be gotten hold of'', <tt>apratim\u0101n\u00e1</tt> ''incomparable'', <tt>aducchun\u00e1</tt> ''bringing no harm'', <tt>apak\u1e63apucch\u00e1</tt> ''without sides or tail''.\n\nb. But a number of examples (few in proportion to those already instanced) have the prefix accented (like the simple descriptives: 1288 a): thus, <tt>\u00e1k\u1e63iti</tt> ''indestructible'', <tt>\u00e1gu</tt> ''kineless'', <tt>\u00e1gop\u0101</tt> ''without shepherd'', <tt>\u00e1j\u012bvana</tt> ''lifeless'', <tt>\u00e1n\u0101pi</tt> ''without friends'', <tt>\u00e1\u00e7i\u00e7v\u012b</tt> f.

A very few have the accent on the penult: namely, <tt>a\u00e7\u00e9\u1e63as, aj\u0101\u0301ni</tt>, and <tt>av\u012b\u0301ra</tt> (with retraction, from <tt>v\u012br\u00e1</tt>), <tt>ap\u00fatra</tt> (do., from <tt>putr\u00e1</tt>); and AV. has <tt>abhr\u0101\u0301t\u1e5b</tt>, but RV. <tt>abhr\u0101t\u1e5b\u0301</tt>.\n\nc. In compounds with the prefixes of praise and dispraise, <tt>su</tt> and <tt>dus</tt>, the accent is in the great majority of cases that of the final member: thus, <tt>suk\u00e1lpa</tt> ''of easy make'', <tt>subh\u00e1ga</tt> ''well portioned'', <tt>sun\u00e1k\u1e63atra</tt> ''of propitious star'', <tt>suputr\u00e1</tt> ''having excellent sons'', <tt>sugop\u0101\u0301</tt> ''well-shepherded'', <tt>suk\u012brt\u00ed</tt> ''of good fame'', <tt>sug\u00e1ndhi</tt> ''fragrant'', <tt>sub\u0101h\u00fa</tt> ''well-armed'', <tt>suy\u00e1\u1e41tu</tt> ''of easy control'', <tt>sukr\u00e1tu</tt> ''of good capacity'', <tt>suh\u0101\u0301rd</tt> ''good-hearted'', <tt>susr\u00e1j</tt> ''well-garlanded'', <tt>suv\u00e1rman</tt> ''well-cuirassed'', <tt>suv\u0101\u0301sas</tt> ''well-clad'', <tt>supr\u00e1\u1e47\u012bti</tt> ''well guiding;'' <tt>durbh\u00e1ga</tt> ''ill-portioned'', <tt>durd\u1e5b\u0301\u00e7\u012bka</tt> ''of evil aspect'', <tt>durdh\u00e1ra</tt> ''hard to restrain'', <tt>durg\u00e1ndhi</tt> ''ill-savored'', <tt>dur\u0101dh\u012b\u0301</tt> ''of evil designs'', <tt>durdh\u00e1rtu</tt> ''hard to restrain'', <tt>du\u1e63\u1e6d\u00e1r\u012btu</tt> ''hard to excel'', <tt>duraty\u00e9tu</tt> ''hard to cross'', <tt>durdh\u00far</tt> ''ill-yoked'', <tt>dur\u1e47\u0101\u0301man</tt> ''ill-named'', <tt>durv\u0101\u0301sas</tt> ''ill-clad''.\n\nd.

The associative prefix <tt>sa</tt> or (less often) <tt>sah\u00e1</tt> is treated like an adjective element, and itself takes the accent in a possessive compound: thus, <tt>s\u00e1kratu</tt> ''of joint will'', <tt>s\u00e1n\u0101man</tt> ''of like name'', <tt>s\u00e1r\u016bpa</tt> ''of similar form'', <tt>s\u00e1yoni</tt> ''having a common origin'', <tt>s\u00e1v\u0101cas</tt> ''of assenting words'', <tt>s\u00e1toka</tt> ''having progeny along, with one's progeny'', <tt>s\u00e1br\u0101hma\u1e47a</tt> ''together with the Brahmans'', <tt>s\u00e1m\u016bla</tt> ''with the root'', <tt>s\u0101\u0301ntarde\u00e7a</tt> ''with the intermediate directions;'' <tt>sah\u00e1gopa</tt> ''with the shepherd'', <tt>sah\u00e1vatsa</tt> ''accompanied by one's young'', <tt>sah\u00e1patn\u012b</tt> ''having her husband with her'', <tt>sah\u00e1p\u016bru\u1e63a</tt> ''along with our men''.\n\ng. In RV. (save in a doubtful case or two), only <tt>saha</tt> in such compounds gives the meaning of ''having with one, accompanied by;'' and, since <tt>saha</tt> governs the instrumental, the words beginning with it might be of the prepositional class (below, 1310). But in AV. both <tt>sa</tt> and <tt>saha</tt> have this value (as illustrated by examples given above); and in the later language, the combinations with <tt>sa</tt> are much the more numerous.\n\nh. There are a few exceptions, in which the accent is that of the final member: thus, <tt>saj\u00f3\u1e63a, saj\u00f3\u1e63as, sad\u1e5b\u0301\u00e7a, sapr\u00e1thas, sab\u0101\u0301dhas, samany\u00fa</tt> and AV. shows the accent on the final syllable in <tt>s\u0101n\u0304g\u00e1</tt> (\u00c7B. <tt>s\u0101\u0301n\u0304ga</tt>) and the substantivized (1312) <tt>savidyut\u00e1</tt>.\n\ni. Possessive compounds with the exclamatory prefixes <tt>ka</tt> etc. are too few in the older language to furnish ground for any rule as to accent: <tt>k\u00e1bandha</tt> is perhaps an example of such.\n\n1305. Possessive compounds in which a verbal prefix is used as prior member with adjective value, qualifying a noun as final member, are found even in the oldest language, and are rather more common later (compare the descriptive compounds, above, 1289; and the prepositional, below, 1310). They usually have the accent of the prefix.\n\na. Most common are those made with <tt>pra</tt>, <tt>vi</tt>, and <tt>sam</tt>; thus, for example, <tt>pr\u00e1mahas</tt> ''having exceeding might'', <tt>pr\u00e1\u00e7ravas</tt> ''widely famed;'' <tt>v\u00edgr\u0101va</tt> ''of wry neck'', <tt>vy\u00e0n\u0304ga</tt> ''having limbs away or gone, limbless'', <tt>v\u00edj\u0101ni</tt> ''wifeless'', <tt>v\u00edparva</tt> and <tt>v\u00edparus</tt> ''jointless'', <tt>vy\u00e0dhvan</tt> ''of wide ways'', <tt>v\u00edmanas</tt> both ''of wide mind'' and ''mindless'', <tt>v\u00edv\u0101cas</tt> ''of discordant speech;'' <tt>s\u00e1mpatn\u012b</tt> ''having one's husband along'', <tt>s\u00e1mmanas</tt> ''of accordant mind'', <tt>s\u00e1\u1e41sahasra</tt> ''accompanied by a thousand'', <tt>s\u00e1mokas</tt> ''of joint abode''.

It was pointed out in the preceding chapter (1222 h) that the indifferent suffix <tt>ka</tt> is often added to a pure possessive compound, to help the conversion of the compounded stem into an adjective; especially, where the final of the stem is less usual or manageable in adjective inflection.\n\nb. Also, the compound possessive stem occasionally takes further a possessive-making suffix: thus, <tt>ya\u00e7obhag\u00edn, su\u00e7iprin, varavar\u1e47in, d\u012brghas\u016btrin, pu\u1e47yav\u0101gbuddhikarmin, sut\u00e1somavant, t\u0101d\u1e5bgr\u016bpavant, trayoda\u00e7adv\u012bpavant, n\u0101rakap\u0101laku\u1e47\u1e0dalavant, am\u1e5btabuddhimant</tt>.\n\nc. The frequent changes which are undergone by the final of a stem occurring at the end of a compound are noticed further on (1315).\n\n1308. The possessive compounds are not always used in the later language with the simple value of qualifying adjective; often they have a pregnant sense, and become the equivalents of dependent clauses; or the ''having'' which is implied in them obtains virtually the value of our ''having'' as sign of past time.\n\na. Thus, for example, <tt>pr\u0101ptay\u0101uvana</tt> ''possessing attained adolescence'', i.e. ''having arrived at adolescence;'' <tt>anadhigata\u00e7\u0101stra</tt> ''with unstudied books'', i. e.

The boundary between descriptive and dependent compounds is not an absolute one; in certain cases it is open to question, for instance, whether a prior noun, or adjective with noun-value, is used more in a case-relation, or adverbially.\n\nd. Moreover, where the final member is a derivative having both noun and adjective value, it is not seldom doubtful whether an adjective compound is to be regarded as descriptive, made with final adjective, or possessive, made with final noun. Sometimes the accent of the word determines its character in this respect, but not always.\n\ne. A satisfactorily simple and perspicuous classification of the descriptive compounds is not practicable; we cannot hold apart throughout the compounds of noun and of adjective value, but may better group both together, as they appear with prefixed elements of various kinds.\n\n1280. The simplest case is that in which a noun as final member is preceded by a qualifying adjective as prior member.\n\na. In this combination, both noun and adjective may be of any kind, verbal or otherwise. The accent is (as in the corresponding class of dependent noun-compounds: 1267) on the final syllable.\n\nb. Thus, <tt>aj\u00f1\u0101tayak\u1e63m\u00e1</tt> ''unknown disease'', <tt>mah\u0101dhan\u00e1</tt> ''great wealth'', <tt>k\u1e63ipra\u00e7yen\u00e1</tt> ''swift hawk'', <tt>k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u00e7akun\u00ed</tt> ''black bird'', <tt>dak\u1e63i\u1e47\u0101gn\u00ed</tt> ''southern fire'', <tt>uruk\u1e63it\u00ed</tt> ''wide abode'', <tt>adharahan\u00fa</tt> ''lower jaw'', <tt>itarajan\u00e1</tt> ''other folks'', <tt>sarv\u0101tm\u00e1n</tt> ''whole soul'', <tt>ekav\u012br\u00e1</tt> ''sole hero'', <tt>saptar\u1e63\u00ed</tt> ''seven sages'', <tt>t\u1e5bt\u012byasavan\u00e1</tt> ''third libation'', <tt>ekonavi\u1e45\u00e7at\u00ed</tt> ''a score diminished by one'', <tt>j\u0101gratsvapn\u00e1</tt> ''waking sleep'', <tt>y\u0101vayatsakh\u00e1</tt> ''defending friend'', <tt>apak\u1e63\u012byam\u0101\u1e47apak\u1e63\u00e1</tt> ''waning half''.\n\nc. There are not a few exceptions as regards accent. Especially, compounds with <tt>v\u00ed\u00e7va</tt> (in composition, accented <tt>vi\u00e7v\u00e1</tt>), which itself retains the accent: thus, <tt>vi\u00e7v\u00e1dev\u0101s</tt> ''all the gods'', <tt>vi\u00e7v\u00e1m\u0101nu\u1e63a</tt> ''every man''. For words in <tt>ti</tt>, see below, 1287 d. Sporadic cases are <tt>madhy\u00e1\u1e41dina, v\u1e5b\u1e63k\u0101\u0301pi</tt>, both of which show an irregular shift of tone in the prior member; and a few others.\n\nd. Instead of an adjective, the prior member is in a few cases a noun used appositionally, or with a quasi-adjective value. Thus, <tt>r\u0101jayak\u1e63m\u00e1</tt> ''king-disease'', <tt>brahmar\u1e63i</tt> ''priest-sage'', <tt>r\u0101jar\u1e63i</tt> ''king-sage'', <tt>r\u0101jadanta</tt> ''king-tooth'', <tt>devajana</tt> ''god-folk'', <tt>duhit\u1e5bjana</tt> ''daughter-person'', <tt>\u00e7am\u012blat\u0101</tt> ''creeper named'' <tt>\u00e7am\u012b</tt>, <tt>mu\u1e63ik\u0101khy\u0101</tt> ''the name \"mouse\"'', <tt>jaya\u00e7abda</tt> ''the word \"conquer\"'', <tt>ujhita\u00e7abda</tt> ''the word \"deserted\";'' or, more figuratively, <tt>g\u1e5bhanaraka</tt> ''house-hell'' (''house which is a hell''), <tt>\u00e7\u0101p\u0101gni</tt> ''curse-fire'' (''consuming curse'').\n\ne.

Compounds with derivatives in <tt>van</tt> have (like combinations with prefixes: 1169 c) the accent of the final member: namely, on the radical syllable.\n\na.

The few compounds with final <tt>man</tt> appear to follow the same rule as those with <tt>van</tt>: thus, <tt>sv\u0101duk\u1e63\u00e1dman</tt> ''sharing out sweets'', <tt>\u0101\u00e7uh\u00e9man</tt> ''steed-impelling''.\n\n1278.

One or two special usages may be noticed. The participle <tt>gata</tt>, ''gone to'', as final of a compound, is used in a loose way in the later language to express relation of various kinds: thus, <tt>jagat\u012bgata</tt> ''existing in the world'', <tt>tvadgata</tt> ''belonging to thee'', <tt>sakh\u012bgata</tt> ''relating to a friend'', <tt>citragata</tt> ''in a picture'', <tt>putragata\u1e41 sneham</tt> ''affection toward a son'', etc. The participle <tt>bh\u016bta</tt> ''been, become'' is used in composition with a noun as hardly more than a grammatical device to give it an adjective form: thus, <tt>ida\u1e41 tamobh\u016btam</tt> ''this creation, being darkness'' (''existing in the condition of darkness''); <tt>t\u0101\u1e41 ratnabh\u016bta\u1e41 lokasya</tt> ''her, being the pearl of the world;'' <tt>k\u1e63etrabh\u016bt\u0101 sm\u1e5bt\u0101 n\u0101r\u012b b\u012bjabh\u016btah smrta\u1e25 pum\u0101n</tt> ''a woman is regarded as a field; a man, as seed;'' and so on.\n\nd.

In <tt>nem\u00e1dhiti, medh\u00e1s\u0101ti, van\u00e1dhiti</tt> (all RV.), the accent of the prior member is changed from penult to final.\n\nc. Where the verbal character of the derivative is lost, the general rule of final accent (1267) is followed: thus, <tt>devahet\u00ed</tt> ''weapon of the gods'', <tt>devasumat\u00ed</tt> ''favor of the gods'', <tt>brahmacit\u00ed</tt> ''Brahman-pile''. Also in <tt>sarvajy\u0101n\u00ed</tt> ''entire ruin'', the accent is that of compounds with ordinary nouns.\n\n1275.

Thus, <tt>uktha\u00e7a\u1e45s\u00edn</tt> ''psalm-singing'', <tt>vratac\u0101r\u00edn</tt> ''vow-performing'', <tt>\u1e5b\u1e63abhad\u0101y\u00edn</tt> ''bullock-giving'', <tt>satyav\u0101d\u00edn</tt> ''truth-speaking'', <tt>\u00e7ro\u1e47ipratod\u00edn</tt> ''thigh-pounding''.\n\n1276. There is a group of compounds with derivatives in <tt>i</tt>, having the accent on the penult or radical syllable.\n\na.

In a few instances, the accent is (as in compounds with ordinary adjectives: above, 1268) that of the prior member: thus, <tt>mar\u00fadv\u1e5bdha, sut\u00e9kara, div\u00edcara</tt> (and other more questionable words). And <tt>d\u00fagha</tt> ''milking, yielding'' is so accented as final: thus, <tt>madhud\u00fagha, k\u0101mad\u00fagha</tt>.\n\nc. Case-forms are especially frequent in the prior members of compounds with adjective derivatives in <tt>a</tt> showing <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening of the root: thus, fox example, <tt>abhaya\u1e41kar\u00e1, yudhi\u1e41gam\u00e1, dhana\u1e41jay\u00e1, pura\u1e41dar\u00e1, vi\u00e7vambhar\u00e1, div\u0101kar\u00e1, talpe\u00e7ay\u00e1, divi\u1e63\u1e6dambh\u00e1</tt>.\n\n1271. Compounds with verbal nouns and adjectives in <tt>ana</tt> are very numerous, and have the accent always on the radical syllable (as in the case of compounds with verbal prefixes: 1150 e).\n\na. Examples are: <tt>ke\u00e7av\u00e1rdhana</tt> ''hair-increasing'', <tt>\u0101yu\u1e63prat\u00e1ra\u1e47a</tt> ''life-lengthening'', <tt>tan\u016bp\u0101\u0301na</tt> ''body-protecting;'' <tt>devah\u00e9\u1e0dana</tt> ''hatred of the gods'', <tt>pu\u1e41s\u00favana</tt> ''giving birth to males''.\n\nb. A very few apparent exceptions as regards accent are really cases where the derivative has lost its verbal character: thus, <tt>yamas\u0101dan\u00e1</tt> ''Yama's realm'', <tt>\u0101ch\u00e1dvidh\u0101na</tt> ''means of protection''.\n\nc. An accusative-form is sometimes found before a derivative in <tt>ana</tt>: thus, <tt>sar\u016bpa\u1e41k\u00e1ra\u1e47a, ayak\u1e63ma\u1e41k\u00e1ra\u1e47a, subh\u0101ga\u1e41k\u00e1ra\u1e47a, vana\u1e41k\u00e1ra\u1e47a</tt>.\n\n1272. a. The action-nouns in <tt>ya</tt> (1213) are not infrequent in composition as final member, and retain their own proper accent (as in combination with prefixes). Sufficient examples were given above (1213).\n\nb. The same is true of the equivalent feminines in <tt>ya</tt>: see above, 1213 d.\n\nc. The gerundives in <tt>ya</tt> (1213) hardly occur in the older language in combination with other elements than prefixes. The two <tt>n\u012bvibh\u0101ry\u00e0</tt> and <tt>prathamav\u0101sy\u00e0</tt> (the latter a descriptive) have the accent of the independent words of the same form; <tt>balavij\u00f1ay\u00e1</tt> and <tt>\u00e1\u00e7vabudhya</tt> (?) are inconsistent with these and with one another.\n\n1273. Compounds made with the passive participle in <tt>ta</tt> or <tt>na</tt> have the accent of their prior member (as do the combinations of the same words with prefixes: 1085 a).\n\na.

The derivatives in van keep in general the accent of the final member, on the root (compare 1169 c, 1277): thus, <tt>\u0101\u00e7up\u00e1tvan</tt> and <tt>raghup\u00e1tvan</tt> ''swift-flying'', <tt>puroy\u0101\u0301van</tt> ''going in front'', <tt>suk\u1e5b\u0301tvan</tt> ''well-doing;'' and <tt>sut\u00e1rman</tt> and <tt>suv\u00e1hman</tt> and <tt>raghuy\u0101\u0301man</tt> are probably to be classed with them. But the negative prefix has the accent even before these: thus, <tt>\u00e1yajvan, \u00e1r\u0101van, \u00e1prayutvan</tt>; and <tt>saty\u00e1madvan</tt> (if it be not possessive) has the accent of its prior member.\n\nc. A few words in <tt>i</tt> seem to have (as in dependent compounds: 1276) he accent on the radical syllable: thus, <tt>durg\u1e5b\u0301bhi, \u1e5bjuv\u00e1ni, tuvi\u1e63v\u00e1\u1e47i</tt>.\n\nd. The derivatives in <tt>ti</tt> are variously treated: the negative prefix has always the accent before them: as, <tt>\u00e1citti, \u00e1bh\u016bti, \u00e1n\u0101h\u016bti</tt>; with <tt>su</tt> and <tt>dus</tt>, the compound is accented now on the prefix and now on the final, and in some words on either (<tt>s\u00fan\u012bti</tt> and <tt>sun\u012bt\u00ed</tt>, <tt>d\u00fa\u1e63\u1e6duti</tt> and <tt>du\u1e63\u1e6dut\u00ed</tt>); with other elements, the accent of the prefix prevails: thus, <tt>s\u00e1huti, sadh\u00e1stuti, pur\u00f3hiti, p\u016brv\u00e1p\u012bti, p\u016brvy\u00e1stuti</tt>.\n\ne. The derivatives in <tt>in</tt> have, as in general, the accent on the suffix: thus, <tt>p\u016brv\u0101s\u00edn, bahuc\u0101r\u00edn, s\u0101dhudev\u00edn, sav\u0101s\u00edn, keval\u0101d\u00edn</tt>. But, with the negative prefix, <tt>\u00e1n\u0101min, \u00e1vit\u0101rin</tt>.\n\nf. Other combinations are too various in treatment, or are represented by too few examples in accentuated texts, to justify the setting up of rules respecting them.\n\n1288. Of the remaining combinations, those made with the inseparable prefixes form in some measure a class by themselves.\n\n1. a. The negative prefix <tt>a</tt> or <tt>an</tt>, when it directly negatives the word to which it is added, has a very decided tendency to take the accent.\n\nb. We have seen above (1283) that it does so even in the case of present and perfect and future participles, although these in combination with a verbal prefix retain their own accent (1085: but there are exceptions, as <tt>avad\u00e1nt, apa\u00e7y\u00e1nt</tt>, etc. \u00c7B.); and also in the case of a root-stem, if this be already compounded with another element (1286 b). And the same is true of its other combinations.\n\nc. Thus, with various adjective words: <tt>\u00e1tandra, \u00e1dabhra, \u00e1d\u0101\u00e7uri, \u00e1n\u1e5bju, \u00e1devayu, \u00e1t\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aj, \u00e1tavy\u0101\u1e45s, \u00e1n\u0101min, \u00e1dvay\u0101vin, \u00e1pracetas, \u00e1napatyavant, \u00e1nupadasvant, \u00e1pram\u0101yuka, \u00e1mamri, \u00e1prajaj\u00f1i, \u00e1vid\u012bdhayu, \u00e1nagnidagdha, \u00e1k\u0101makar\u00e7ana, \u00e1pa\u00e7c\u0101ddaghvan</tt>.

But there are a number of exceptions, in which the accent is on the final syllable, without regard to the original accentuation of the final member: thus, for example, <tt>acitr\u00e1, a\u00e7r\u012br\u00e1, avipr\u00e1, ayaj\u00f1iy\u00e1, an\u0101sm\u0101k\u00e1, asth\u016br\u00ed, an\u0101\u00e7\u00fa, ajaray\u00fa, an\u0101mayitn\u00fa</tt>; and in <tt>am\u00edtra</tt> ''enemy'', and <tt>av\u012b\u0301ra</tt> ''unmanly'', there is a retraction of the accent from the final syllable of the final member to its penult.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"425064":{"pageid":425064,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/526","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\n1286. The root-stem (pure root, or with <tt>t</tt> added after a short final vowel: 1147 d) is very often combined with a preceding adverbial word, of various kinds; and in the combination it retains the accent.\n\na.

When, however, a root-stem is already in composition, whether with a verbal prefix or an element of other character, the further added negative itself takes the accent (as in case of an ordinary adjective: below, 1288 a): thus, for example, <tt>\u00e1n\u0101k\u1e63it</tt> ''not abiding'', <tt>\u00e1n\u0101v\u1e5bt</tt> ''not turning back'', <tt>\u00e1vidvi\u1e63</tt> ''not showing hostility'', <tt>\u00e1du\u1e63k\u1e5bt</tt> ''not ill-doing'', <tt>\u00e1na\u00e7vad\u0101</tt> ''not giving a horse'', <tt>\u00e1pa\u00e7uhan</tt> ''not slaying cattle'' (<tt>an\u0101g\u0101\u0301s</tt> would be an exception, if it contained \u221a<tt>g\u0101</tt>: which is very unlikely). Similar combinations with <tt>su</tt> seem to retain the radical accent: thus, <tt>suprat\u00far, sv\u0101bh\u016b\u0301, sv\u0101y\u00faj</tt>: <tt>sv\u0101\u0301v\u1e5bj</tt> is an unsupported exception.\n\nc. A few other exceptions occur, mostly of doubtful character, as <tt>pr\u00e1tipr\u0101\u00e7, sadh\u00e1stha, \u00e1dhrigu</tt>, and the words having <tt>a\u00f1c</tt> as final member (407 ff.: if this element is not, after all, a suffix)  compare 1269 a.\n\n1287. Other verbal derivatives, requiring to be treated apart from the general body of adjectives, are few and of minor importance. Thus:\n\na. The derivatives in <tt>a</tt> are in great part of doubtful character, became of the possibility of their being used with substantive value to make a possessive compound. The least ambiguous, probably, are the derivatives from present-stems (1148 j), which have the accent on the suffix: thus, <tt>asunv\u00e1, apa\u00e7y\u00e1, ak\u1e63udhy\u00e1, avidasy\u00e1, an\u0101m\u1e5b\u1e47\u00e1, sad\u0101p\u1e5b\u1e47\u00e1, punarmany\u00e1</tt>; and with them belong such cases as <tt>st\u1e5bp\u00e1, av\u1e5bdh\u00e1, ara\u1e41gam\u00e1, urukram\u00e1, ev\u0101vad\u00e1, satr\u0101sah\u00e1, puna\u1e25sar\u00e1, pura\u1e25sar\u00e1</tt>; and the nouns <tt>s\u0101yambhav\u00e1, sahac\u0101r\u00e1, pr\u0101ta\u1e25s\u0101v\u00e1, mithoyodh\u00e1</tt>. Differently accented, on the other hand, although apparently of the same formation, are such as <tt>\u00e1napasphura, \u00e1navahvara</tt> (compare the compounds noticed at 1286 b), <tt>sad\u0101\u0301v\u1e5bdha, s\u016b\u0301bharva, nyagr\u00f3dha, puro\u1e0d\u0101\u0301\u00e7a, sadham\u0101\u0301da, sud\u00fagha, sup\u00e1ca, suh\u00e1va</tt>, and others.

Examples are: <tt>an\u0101py\u00e1, anindy\u00e1, abudhy\u00e1, asahy\u00e1, ayodhy\u00e1, amoky\u00e1</tt>; <tt>advi\u1e63e\u1e47y\u00e1</tt>; <tt>ahnav\u0101yy\u00e1</tt>; and, along with verbal prefixes, the cases are <tt>asa\u1e41khyey\u00e1, apram\u1e5b\u1e63y\u00e1, anapav\u1e5bjy\u00e1, anatyudy\u00e1, an\u0101dh\u1e5b\u1e63y\u00e1, avimoky\u00e1, an\u0101nuk\u1e5bty\u00e1</tt> (the accent of the simple word being <tt>sa\u1e41khy\u00e9ya</tt> etc.).\n\nb. Exceptions in regard to accent are: <tt>\u00e1nedya, \u00e1d\u0101bhya, \u00e1gohya, \u00e1jo\u1e63ya, \u00e1yabhya</tt>.

And <tt>\u00e1ghnya</tt> and <tt>aghny\u00e1</tt> occur together.\n\nc. The only compounds of these words with other adverbial elements in V. are <tt>s\u00fayabhya</tt> (accented like its twin <tt>\u00e1yabhya</tt>) and <tt>prathamav\u0101sy\u00e0</tt> (which retains the final circumflex), and perhaps <tt>ekav\u0101dy\u00e1</tt>.\n\nd. The neuter nouns of the same form (1213 c: except <tt>sadh\u00e1stutya</tt>) retain their own accent after an adverbial prior member: thus, <tt>purvap\u0101\u0301yya, p\u016brvap\u00e9ya, amutrabh\u016b\u0301ya</tt>; and <tt>saha\u00e7\u00e9yya</tt>.

Some of the other verbal derivatives which have rules of \ntheir own as to accent etc. may be next noticed.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"425066":{"pageid":425066,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/519","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\na. A principal exception with regard to accent is <tt>p\u00e1ti</tt> ''master, lord'' (and its feminine <tt>p\u00e1tn\u012b</tt>), compounds with which usually retain the accent of the prior member: thus, <tt>praj\u0101\u0301pati, v\u00e1supati, \u00e1tithipati, g\u00f3pati, g\u1e5bh\u00e1patn\u012b</tt>, etc. etc. (compare the verbal nouns in <tt>ti</tt>, below, 1274). But in a few words <tt>p\u00e1ti</tt> retains its own accent: thus, <tt>vi\u00e7p\u00e1ti, rayip\u00e1ti, pa\u00e7up\u00e1ti, vasup\u00e1tn\u012b</tt>, etc.; and the more general rule is followed in <tt>apsar\u0101pat\u00ed</tt> and <tt>vr\u0101japat\u00ed</tt> (AV.), and <tt>nad\u012bpat\u00ed</tt> (VS.), <tt>citpat\u00ed</tt> (MS.; elsewhere <tt>citp\u00e1ti</tt>).\n\nb. Other exceptions are sporadic only: for example, <tt>janar\u0101\u0301jan, devav\u00e1rman, hira\u1e47yat\u00e9jas, p\u1e5btan\u0101h\u00e1va, godh\u016b\u0301ma</tt> and <tt>\u00e7akadh\u016b\u0301ma</tt> (but <tt>dh\u016bm\u00e1</tt>); <tt>v\u0101c\u0101\u0301stena</tt>.\n\nc. The appearance of a case-form in such compounds is rare: examples are <tt>d\u00edvodasa, v\u0101c\u0101\u0301stena, ucc\u0101\u00ed\u1e25\u00e7ravas, ucc\u0101\u00edrgho\u1e63a, d\u016br\u00e9bh\u0101s</tt> (the three last in possessive application).\n\nd. A number of compounds are accented on both members: thus, <tt>\u00e7\u00e1c\u012bp\u00e1ti, s\u00e1dasp\u00e1ti, b\u1e5b\u0301hasp\u00e1ti, v\u00e1nasp\u00e1ti, r\u00e1thasp\u00e1ti, j\u0101\u0301sp\u00e1ti</tt> (also <tt>j\u0101\u0301spati</tt>), <tt>n\u00e1r\u0101\u00e7a\u1e45sa, t\u00e1n\u016bn\u00e1pt\u1e5b, t\u00e1n\u016bn\u00e1p\u0101t</tt> (<tt>tan\u016b\u0301</tt> as independent word), <tt>\u00e7\u00fana\u1e25\u00e7\u00e9pa</tt>. And \u00c7B. has a long list of metronymics having the anomalous accentuation <tt>k\u0101\u00fats\u012bp\u00fatra, g\u0101\u0301rg\u012bp\u00fatra</tt>, etc.\n\n1268. The compounds having an ordinary adjective as final member are (as already noticed) comparatively few.\n\na. So far as can be gathered from the scanty examples occurring in the older language, they retain the accent of the prior member: thus, <tt>g\u00e1vi\u1e63\u1e6dhira</tt> (AV. <tt>gav\u00ed\u1e63\u1e6dhira</tt>), <tt>tan\u016b\u0301\u00e7ubhra, m\u00e1deraghu, yaj\u00f1\u00e1dhira, s\u0101\u0301mavipra, til\u00e1mi\u00e7ra</tt> (but <tt>t\u00edla</tt>); but <tt>k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dapacy\u00e1</tt> ''ripening in cultivated soil''.\n\n1269. The adjective dependent compounds having as final member the bare root \u2014 or, if it end in a short vowel, generally with an added <tt>t</tt> \u2014 are very numerous in all periods of the language, as has been already repeatedly noticed (thus, 383 f\u2013h, 1147). They are accented on the root.\n\na. In a very few instances, the accent of words having apparently or conjecturally this origin is otherwise laid: thus, <tt>\u00e1\u1e45satra, \u00e1narvi\u00e7, sv\u0101\u0301v\u1e5bj, praty\u00e1k\u1e63ad\u1e5b\u00e7, p\u00fara\u1e41dhi, \u00f3\u1e63adhi, \u00e1rami\u1e63, u\u00e7\u00e1dagh, vats\u00e1pa, \u00e1bda</tt>.\n\nb. Before a final root-stem appears not very seldom a case-form: for example, <tt>pata\u1e41g\u00e1, gir\u0101v\u1e5b\u0301dh, dhiy\u0101j\u00far, ak\u1e63\u1e47ay\u0101dr\u00fah, h\u1e5bdisp\u1e5b\u0301\u00e7, divisp\u1e5b\u0301\u00e7, vanes\u00e1h, divi\u1e63\u00e1d, an\u0304ge\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101\u0301, h\u1e5bsv\u00e1s, p\u1e5btsut\u00far, apsuj\u00e1</tt>.\n\nC. The root-stem has sometimes a middle or passive value: for example, <tt>manoy\u00faj</tt> ''yoked'' (''yoking themselves'') ''by the will'', <tt>h\u1e5bday\u0101v\u00eddh</tt> ''pierced to the heart'', <tt>manuja</tt> ''born of Manu''.\n\n1270. Compounds made with verbal derivatives in <tt>a</tt>, both of action and of agency, are numerous, and take the accent usually on their final syllable (as in the case of compounds with verbal prefixes: 1148 m).<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"425067":{"pageid":425067,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/518","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><tt>{{hwe|dhan\u00fas|indradhan\u00fas}}</tt> ''Indra's bow'', <tt>brahmagav\u012b\u0301</tt> ''the Brahman's cow'', <tt>vi\u1e63agir\u00ed</tt> ''poison-mount'', <tt>mitral\u0101bha</tt> ''acquisition of friends'', <tt>m\u016brkha\u00e7at\u0101ni</tt> ''hundreds of fools'', <tt>v\u012brasenasuta</tt> ''V\u012b\u0301rasena's son'', <tt>r\u0101jendra</tt> ''chief of kings'', <tt>asmatputr\u0101s</tt> ''our sons'', <tt>tadvacas</tt> ''his words;'' \u2014 of dative, <tt>p\u0101dodaka</tt> ''water for the feet'', <tt>m\u0101sanicaya</tt> ''accumulation for a month;'' \u2014 of instrumental, <tt>\u0101tmas\u0101d\u1e5b\u00e7ya</tt> ''likeness with self'', <tt>dh\u0101ny\u0101rtha</tt> ''wealth acquired by grain'', <tt>dharmapatn\u012b</tt> ''lawful spouse'', <tt>pit\u1e5bbandh\u00fa</tt> ''paternal relation;'' \u2014 of ablative, <tt>apsara\u1e25sambhava</tt> ''descent from a nymph'', <tt>madviyoga</tt> ''separation from me'', <tt>c\u0101urabhaya</tt> ''fear of a thief;'' \u2014 of locative, <tt>jalakr\u012b\u1e0d\u0101</tt> ''sport in the water'', <tt>gr\u0101mav\u0101sa</tt> ''abode in the village'', <tt>puru\u1e63\u0101n\u1e5bta</tt> ''untruth about a man;'' \u2014 of accusative, <tt>nagaragamana</tt> ''going to the city''.\n\n1265. Dependent Adjective-compounds. In this division, only a very small proportion of the compounds have an ordinary adjective as final member; but usually a participle, or a derivative of agency with the value of a participle. The prior member stands in any case-relation which is possible in the independent construction of such words.\n\na. Examples are: of locative relation, <tt>sth\u0101l\u012bpakva</tt> ''cooked in a pot'', <tt>a\u00e7vakovida</tt> ''knowing in horses'', <tt>vaya\u1e25sama</tt> ''alike in age'', <tt>yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira</tt> ''steadfast in battle'', <tt>tan\u016b\u0301\u00e7ubhra</tt> ''beautiful in body;'' \u2014 of instrumental, <tt>m\u0101t\u1e5bsad\u1e5b\u00e7a</tt> ''like his mother;'' \u2014 of dative, <tt>gohita</tt> ''good for cattle;'' \u2014 of ablative, <tt>bhavadanya</tt> ''other than you'', <tt>garbh\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dama</tt> ''eighth from birth'', <tt>d\u1e5b\u00e7yetara</tt> ''other than visible'' (i. e.

We take up now some of the principal groups of compounds falling under these two heads, in order to notice their specialities of formation and use, their relative frequency, their accentuation, and so on.\n\n1267. Compounds having as final member ordinary nouns (such, namely, as do not distinctly exhibit the character of verbal nouns, of action or agency) are quite common. They are regularly and usually accented on the final syllable, without reference to the accent of either constituent. Examples were given above (1264 a).<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"625774":{"pageid":625774,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/501","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>and <tt>\u1e5bgm\u00edn</tt> in RV., <tt>v\u0101gm\u00edn</tt> in \u00c7B. \u2014 no such nouns are found in actual use beside them. In the later language, <tt>min</tt> is used as independent element in a very few words: thus, <tt>gomin</tt> ''possessing cattle'', <tt>sv\u0101min</tt> (S\u016btras and later) ''master, lord'' (<tt>sva</tt> ''own''), <tt>kakudmin</tt> ''humped''.\n\nb. The two words <tt>\u1e5bgm\u00edn</tt> and <tt>v\u0101gm\u00edn</tt> show not only reversion but also sonantizing of an original palatal.\n\n1232. \u0935\u093f\u0928\u094d <tt>vin</tt>. The adjectives made with this suffix are also not numerous. They have the same meanings with those in \u0907\u0928\u094d <tt>in</tt>. The accent is on the suffix.\n\na. The RV. has ten adjectives in <tt>vin</tt>; they become rather more common later. Though for them may be suspected a similar origin to those in <tt>yin</tt> and <tt>min</tt> (above), signs of it are much less clearly traceable.\n\nb. The great majority have <tt>vin</tt> added after as: e. g. <tt>namasv\u00edn</tt> ''reverential'', <tt>tapasv\u00edn</tt> ''heated'', <tt>tejasv\u00edn</tt> ''brilliant'', <tt>ya\u00e7asv\u00edn</tt> ''beautiful'', and so <tt>retasv\u00edn, enasv\u00edn, harasv\u00edn</tt>, etc.; and <tt>\u00e7atasv\u00edn, \u00e7rotrasv\u00edn, r\u016bpasvin</tt> have an inserted <tt>s</tt>, by analogy with them. Most others have \u0101 (sometimes, by lengthening): thus, <tt>gl\u0101v\u00edn, medh\u0101v\u00edn, m\u0101y\u0101v\u00edn, sabh\u0101v\u00edn, a\u1e63\u1e6dr\u0101v\u00edn</tt> ''obedient to the goad'', <tt>dvay\u0101v\u00edn</tt> ''double-minded'', <tt>ubhay\u0101v\u00edn</tt> ''possessing of both kinds'', <tt>dhanv\u0101vin, tandr\u0101vin, \u0101may\u0101v\u00edn, \u0101tat\u0101v\u00edn</tt>. More rarely, <tt>vin</tt> is added after another consonant than <tt>s</tt>: thus, <tt>v\u0101gv\u00edn, dh\u1e5b\u1e63adv\u00edn, \u0101tmanv\u00edn, kumudvin, sragvin, yajvin, ajvin</tt>. The doubtful word <tt>vya\u00e7nuv\u00edn</tt> (VS., once: TB. <tt>vy\u00e1\u00e7niya</tt>) appears to add the ending (or <tt>in</tt>, with euphonic <tt>v</tt>) to a present tense-stem.\n\nc. An external form of combination is seen only in <tt>v\u0101gv\u00edn</tt> and <tt>dh\u1e5b\u1e63adv\u00edn</tt> (both Vedic), with the common reversion of a palatal in <tt>sragvin</tt>.\n\n1233. \u0935\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d <tt>vant</tt>. Very numerous possessive adjectives are made by this suffix, from noun-stems of every form, both in the earlier language and in the later.\n\na. The accent generally remains upon the primitive, without change; but an accent resting on a stem-final, if this be anything but <tt>\u00e1</tt> or <tt>\u0101\u0301</tt>, is in the majority of cases thrown forward upon the suffix. As to inflection, formation of feminine, etc., see 452 ff.\n\nb.

This is a twin-suffix to \u0935\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d <tt>vant</tt> (above, 1233); their derivatives have the same value, and are to some extent exchangeable with one another. But possessives in \u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d <tt>mant</tt> are much less frequent (in the older language, about a third as many), and are only very rarely made from <tt>a</tt>-stems.\n\na. If the accent of the primitive word is on the final, it is in the great majority of instances (three quarters) thrown forward upon the added suffix; otherwise, it maintains its place unchanged.

The adverb <tt>\u0101\u00e7um\u00e1t</tt> appears to be related to adverbs in <tt>v\u00e1t</tt> as the suffix <tt>mant</tt> to <tt>vant</tt>.\n\nf.

It has been seen above (especially in connection with the suffixes <tt>a</tt> and <tt>ya</tt>) that the neuter of a derivative adjective is frequently used as an abstract noun. There are, however, two suffixes which have in the later language the specific office of making abstract nouns from adjectives and nouns; and these are found also, more sparingly used, in the oldest language, each having there one or two other evidently related suffixes beside it.\n\na.

A few suffixes make no change in the character as part of speech of the primitive to which they are added, but either are merely formal appendages, leaving the value of the word what it was before, or make a change of degree, or introduce some other modification of meaning.\n\n1242. The suffixes of comparison and ordinal suffixes have for the most part been treated already, and need only a reference here.\n\na. \u0924\u0930 <tt>tara</tt> and \u0924\u092e <tt>tama</tt> are the usual secondary suffixes of adjective comparison: respecting their use as such, see above, 471\u2013473; respecting the use of <tt>tama</tt> as ordinal etc. suffix, see 487\u20138; respecting that of their accusatives as adverbial suffixes to prepositions etc., see 1111 e.\n\nb.

Apparently by false analogy with <tt>tatith\u00e1</tt> etc. (above, d), the quasi-ordinals <tt>t\u0101vatitha, y\u0101vatitha, bahutitha</tt> are made, as if with a suffix <tt>titha</tt> (also <tt>katititha</tt>, late, for <tt>katith\u00e1</tt>); and, it is said, from other words meaning ''a number or collection'', as <tt>ga\u1e47a, p\u016bga, sa\u1e41gha</tt>; but none such are quotable.\n\n1243. Of diminutive suffixes there are none in Sanskrit with clearly developed meaning and use. The occasional employment of <tt>ka</tt>, in a somewhat indistinct way, to make diminutives, has been noticed above (1222).\n\n1244. Of the ordinary adjective-making suffixes, given above, some occasionally make adjectives from adjectives, with slight or imperceptible modification of value.

Their fem. is in -<tt>y\u012b</tt>.\n\nb. \u0924\u094d\u092f <tt>tya</tt> makes a class of adjectives from particles: e. g. <tt>n\u00edtya</tt> ''own'', <tt>n\u00ed\u1e63\u1e6dya</tt> ''foreign'', <tt>am\u0101\u0301tya</tt> ''companion'', etc. As the examples show, the accent of the primitive is retained. The fem. is in -<tt>ty\u0101</tt>.\n\nc. The other quotable examples are <tt>\u00e1patya, \u0101v\u00ed\u1e63\u1e6dya, s\u00e1nutya, antastya, anyatastya-, tatastya, kutastya, atratya, tatratya, yatratya, kutratya, ihatya, upatya, adhitya, pr\u0101tastya, dak\u1e63i\u1e47\u0101tya</tt> (instead of which, the regular form, is generally found <tt>d\u0101k\u1e63i\u1e47\u0101tya</tt>, apparently a further <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt>-derivative from it: as if ''belonging to the southerners''), and <tt>p\u0101\u00e7c\u0101ttya</tt> and <tt>p\u0101urastya</tt> (of a similar character: these three last are said by the grammarians to be accented on the final, as is proper for <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt>-derivatives); <tt>apty\u00e1</tt> and <tt>\u0101pty\u00e1</tt> perhaps contain the same suffix. In <tt>antastya</tt> and <tt>pr\u0101tastya</tt> is seen external combination.\n\nd. The <tt>y</tt> of <tt>tya</tt> is in RV. always to be read as <tt>i</tt> after a heavy syllable.\n\ne. \u0924 <tt>ta</tt> forms <tt>ekat\u00e1, dvit\u00e1</tt>, and <tt>trit\u00e1</tt>, also <tt>muh\u016brt\u00e1</tt> ''moment'', and apparently <tt>avat\u00e1</tt> ''well'' (for water).\n\nf.

With \u0924\u0928 <tt>tana</tt> or (in a few cases) \u0924\u094d\u0928 <tt>tna</tt> are made adjectives from adverbs, nearly always of time: e. g. <tt>pratn\u00e1</tt> ''ancient'', <tt>n\u016b\u0301tana</tt> or <tt>n\u016b\u0301tna</tt> ''present'', <tt>san\u0101t\u00e1na</tt> or <tt>san\u00e1tna</tt> ''lasting'', <tt>div\u0101tana</tt> ''of the day'', <tt>\u00e7v\u00e1stana</tt> ''of tomorrow'', <tt>hyastana</tt> ''of yesterday''.

As in secondary derivation (1203 d), so also as prior member of a compound, a stem sometimes shortens its final long vowel (usually <tt>\u012b</tt>, rarely <tt>\u0101</tt>): thus, in V., <tt>rodasipr\u0101\u0301, p\u1e5bthivi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101\u0301, p\u1e5bthivi\u1e63\u00e1d, dh\u0101\u0301rap\u016bta, dh\u0101rav\u0101k\u00e1</tt>; in B., <tt>p\u1e5bthivi-d\u0101, -bh\u0101ga, -lok\u00e1, sarasvatik\u1e5bta, sen\u0101nigr\u0101ma\u1e47y\u0101\u00f9</tt>; in S., <tt>garbhinipr\u0101ya\u00e7citta, s\u0101midhenipr\u0101i\u1e63tya, vasat\u012bvariparihara\u1e47a, ek\u0101da\u00e7inilin\u0304ga, prapharvid\u0101, devatalak\u1e63a\u1e47a, devatapradh\u0101natva</tt>; later, <tt>devakinandana, lak\u1e63mivardhana, kum\u0101ridatta, muh\u016brtaja, i\u1e63\u1e6dakacita</tt>, etc.\n\ne. Occasionally, a stem is used as prior member of a compound which does not appear, or not in that form, as an independent word: examples are <tt>mah\u0101</tt> ''great'' (apparently used independently in V. in accusative), <tt>tuvi</tt> ''mighty'' (V.), <tt>dvi</tt> ''two''.\n\nf. Not infrequently, the final member of a compound assumes a special form: see below, 1315.\n\n1250. But a case-form in the prior member of a compound is by no means rare, from the earliest period of the language. Thus:\n\na. Quite often, an accusative, especially before a root-stem, or a derivative in <tt>a</tt> of equivalent meaning: for example, <tt>pata\u1e41g\u00e1</tt> ''going by flight'', <tt>dhana\u1e41jay\u00e1</tt> ''winning wealth'', <tt>abhaya\u1e41kar\u00e1</tt> ''causing absence of danger'', <tt>pu\u1e63\u1e6dimbhar\u00e1</tt> ''bringing prosperity'', <tt>v\u0101cam\u012bn\u0304khay\u00e1</tt> ''inciting the voice;'' but also sometimes before words of other form, as <tt>\u00e1\u00e7vami\u1e63\u1e6di</tt> ''horse-desiring'', <tt>\u00e7ubha\u1e41y\u0101\u0301van</tt> ''going in splendor'', <tt>subh\u0101ga\u1e41k\u00e1ra\u1e47a</tt> ''making happy'', <tt>bhaya\u1e41kart\u1e5b</tt> ''causer of fear''. In a few cases, by analogy with these, a word receives an accusative form to which it has no right: thus, <tt>h\u1e5bda\u1e41s\u00e1ni, mak\u1e63\u00fa\u1e41gama, vasu\u1e41dhara, \u0101tmambhari</tt>.\n\nb. Much more rarely, an instrumental: for example, <tt>gir\u0101v\u1e5b\u0301dh</tt> ''increasing by praise'', <tt>v\u0101c\u0101\u0301stena</tt> ''stealing by incantation'', <tt>kr\u00e1tv\u0101magha</tt> ''gladly bestowing'', <tt>bh\u0101s\u0101\u0301ketu</tt> ''bright with light'', <tt>vidman\u0101\u0301pas</tt> ''active with wisdom''.\n\nC. In a very few instances, a dative: thus, <tt>nare\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101\u0301</tt> ''serving a man'', <tt>asm\u00e9hiti</tt> ''errand to us'', and perhaps <tt>kiyedh\u0101\u0301</tt> and <tt>mahev\u1e5b\u0301dh</tt>.\n\nd. Not seldom, a locative; and this also especially with a root-stem or <tt>a</tt>-derivative: for example, <tt>agreg\u00e1</tt> ''going at the head'', <tt>divik\u1e63\u00edt</tt> ''dwelling in the sky'', <tt>vane\u1e63\u00e1h</tt> ''prevailing in the wood'', <tt>an\u0304ge\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101\u0301</tt> ''existing in the limbs'', <tt>pro\u1e63\u1e6dhe\u00e7ay\u00e1</tt> ''lying on a couch'', <tt>sut\u00e9kara</tt> ''active with the soma'', <tt>div\u00edcara</tt> ''moving in the sky;'' <tt>\u0101r\u00e9\u00e7atru</tt> ''having enemies far removed'', <tt>sumn\u00e1\u0101pi</tt> ''near in favor'', <tt>m\u00e1deraghu</tt> ''hasting in excitement'', <tt>yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira</tt> ''firm in battle'', <tt>antev\u0101sin</tt> ''dwelling near;'' <tt>apsuj\u00e1</tt> ''born in the waters'', <tt>h\u1e5btsv\u00e1s</tt> ''hurling at hearts''.\n\ne.

But the older language has a few examples of the putting together of a genitive with its governing noun, each member of the combination keeping its own accent: see below, 1267 d.\n\nf. Ablative forms are to be seen in <tt>bal\u0101tk\u0101ra</tt> ''violence'' and <tt>bal\u0101tk\u1e5bta</tt>, and perhaps in <tt>par\u0101tpriya</tt>. And a stem in <tt>\u1e5b</tt> sometimes appears in a copulative compound in its nominative form: thus, <tt>pit\u0101putr\u0101u</tt> ''father and son'', <tt>hot\u0101pot\u0101r\u0101u</tt> ''the invoker and purifier''. <tt>Anyonya</tt> ''one another'' is a fused phrase, of nominative and oblique case.\n\ng. In a very few words, plural meaning is signified by plural form: thus, <tt>apsuj\u0101\u0301</tt> etc. (in derivation, also, <tt>apsu</tt> is used as a stem), <tt>h\u1e5btsv\u00e1s, n\u1e5d\u0301\u1e45\u1e25pra\u1e47etra</tt> ''conducting men'', <tt>rujaskara</tt> ''causing pains'', (and dual) <tt>han\u016bkampa</tt> ''trembling of the two jaws''.\n\nh. Much more often, of words having gender-forms, the feminine is used in composition, when the distinctive feminine sense is to be conveyed: e. g. <tt>gop\u012bn\u0101tha</tt> ''master of the shepherdesses'', <tt>d\u0101s\u012bputra</tt> ''son of a female slave'', <tt>m\u1e5bg\u012bd\u1e5b\u00e7</tt> ''gaselle-eyed'', <tt>pra\u1e47\u012bt\u0101pra\u1e47\u00e1yana</tt> ''vessel for consecrated water''.\n\n1251. The accent of compounds is very various, and liable to considerable irregularity even within the limits of the same formation; and it must be left to be pointed out in detail below. All possible varieties are found to occur. Thus:\n\na. Each member of the compound retains its own separate accent. This is the most anomalous and infrequent method. It appears in certain Vedic copulative compounds chiefly composed of the names of divinities (so-called <tt>devat\u0101-dvandvas</tt>: 1255 ff.), and in a small number of aggregations partly containing a genitive case-form as prior member (1267 d).\n\nb. The accent of the compound is that of its prior member. This is especially the case in the great class of possessive compounds; but also in determinatives having the participle in <tt>ta</tt> or <tt>na</tt> as final member, in those beginning with the negative <tt>a</tt> or <tt>an</tt>, and in other less numerous and important classes.\n\nc. The accent of the compound is that of the final member. This is not on so large a scale the case as the preceding; but it is nevertheless quite common, being found in many compounds having a verbal noun or adjective as final member, in compounds beginning with the numerals <tt>dvi</tt> and <tt>tri</tt> or the prefixes <tt>su</tt> and <tt>dus</tt>, and elsewhere in not infrequent exceptions.\n\nd. The compound takes an accent of its own, independent of that of either of its constituents, on its final syllable (not always, of course, to be distinguished from the preceding case). This method is largely followed: especially, by the regular copulatives, and by the great mass of dependent and descriptive noun-compounds, by most possessives beginning with the negative prefix; and by others.\n\ne. The compound has an accent which is altered from that of one of its members. This is everywhere an exceptional and sporadically occurring<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"631273":{"pageid":631273,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/513","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>case, and the instances of it, noted below under each formation, do not require to be assembled here.

Compounds in which the relation of the two members is alternative instead of copulative, though only exceptional, are not very rare: examples are <tt>ny\u016bn\u0101dhika</tt> ''defective or redundant'', <tt>jayapar\u0101jaya</tt> ''victory or defeat'', <tt>kr\u012btotpanna</tt> ''purchased or on hand'', <tt>k\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dhalo\u1e63\u1e6dasama</tt> ''like a log or clod'', <tt>pak\u1e63im\u1e5bgat\u0101</tt> ''the condition of being bird or beast'', <tt>tri\u1e45\u00e7advi\u1e45\u00e7a</tt> ''numbering twenty or thirty'', <tt>catu\u1e63pan\u0304cak\u1e5btvas</tt> ''four or five times'', <tt>dvyek\u0101ntara</tt> ''different by one or two''. A less marked modification of the copulative idea is seen in such instances as <tt>priyasatya</tt> ''agreeable though true'', <tt>pr\u0101rthitadurlabha</tt> ''sought after but hard to obtain;'' or in <tt>\u00e7r\u0101nt\u0101gata</tt> ''arrived weary''.\n\n1253. The noun-copulatives fall, as regards their inflective form, into two classes:\n\n1. a. The compound has the gender and declension of its final member, and is in number a dual or a plural, according to its logical value, as denoting two or more than two individual things.\n\nb. Examples are: <tt>pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101p\u0101n\u0101\u00fa</tt> ''inspiration and expiration'', <tt>vr\u012bhiyav\u0101\u00fa</tt> ''rice and barley'', <tt>\u1e5bks\u0101m\u00e9</tt> ''verse and chant'', <tt>kapotoluk\u0101\u00fa</tt> ''dove and owl'', <tt>candr\u0101dity\u0101u</tt> ''moon and sun'', <tt>hastya\u00e7v\u0101u</tt> ''the elephant and horse'', <tt>aj\u0101v\u00e1yas</tt> ''goats and sheep'', <tt>dev\u0101sur\u0101\u0301s</tt> ''the gods and demons'', <tt>atharv\u0101n\u0304gir\u00e1sas</tt> ''the Atharvans and Angirases'', <tt>samb\u0101dhatandry\u00e0s</tt> ''anxieties and fatigues'', <tt>vidy\u0101karm\u00e1\u1e47\u012b</tt> ''knowledge and action'', <tt>hastya\u00e7v\u0101s</tt> ''elephants and horses;'' of more than two members (no examples quotable from the older language), <tt>\u00e7ayy\u0101sanabhog\u0101s</tt> ''lying, sitting, and eating'', <tt>br\u0101hma\u1e47ak\u1e63atriyavi\u1e6d\u00e7\u016bdr\u0101s</tt> ''a Brahman, Kshatriya, Vai\u00e7ya, and \u00c7\u016bdra'',<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"631752":{"pageid":631752,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/514","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><tt>roga\u00e7okapar\u012bt\u0101pabandhanavyasan\u0101ni</tt> ''disease, pain, grief, captivity, and misfortune''.\n\n2. c. The compound, without regard to the number denoted, or to the gender of its constituents, becomes a neuter singular collective.\n\nd.

That a stem in <tt>\u1e5b</tt> as prior member sometimes takes its nominative form, in <tt>\u0101</tt>, was noticed above, 1250 f.\n\nb. A stem as final member is sometimes changed to an <tt>a</tt>-form to make a neuter collective: thus, <tt>chattrop\u0101naham</tt> ''an umbrella and a shoe''.\n\nc. The grammarians give rules as to the order of the elements composing a copulative compound: thus, that a more important, a briefer, a vowel-initial member should stand first; and that one ending in a should be placed last. Violations of them all, however, are not infrequent.\n\n1255. In the oldest language (RV.), copulative compounds such as appear later are quite rare, the class being chiefly represented by dual combinations of the names of divinities and other personages, and of personified natural objects.\n\na. In these combinations, each name has regularly and usually the dual form, and its own accent; but, in the very rare instances (only three occurrences out of more than three hundred) in which other cases than the nom.-acc.-voc. are formed, the final member only is inflected.\n\nb. Examples are: <tt>\u00edndr\u0101s\u00f3m\u0101, \u00edndr\u0101v\u00ed\u1e63\u1e47\u016b, \u00edndr\u0101b\u1e5b\u0301hasp\u00e1t\u012b, agn\u012b\u0301\u1e63\u00f3m\u0101u, turv\u00e1\u00e7\u0101y\u00e1d\u016b, dy\u0101\u0301v\u0101p\u1e5bthiv\u012b\u0301, u\u1e63\u0101\u0301s\u0101n\u00e1kt\u0101</tt> (and, with intervening words, <tt>n\u00e1kt\u0101</tt>...<tt>u\u1e63\u0101\u0301s\u0101</tt>), <tt>s\u016b\u0301ry\u0101m\u0101\u0301s\u0101</tt>. The only plural is <tt>indr\u0101marutas</tt> (voc.). The cases of other than nominative form are <tt>mitr\u0101\u0301v\u00e1ru\u1e47\u0101bhy\u0101m</tt> and <tt>mitr\u0101\u0301v\u00e1ru\u1e47ayos</tt> (also <tt>mitr\u00e1yor v\u00e1ru\u1e47ayo\u1e25</tt>), and <tt>\u00edndr\u0101v\u00e1ru\u1e47ayos</tt> (each once only).\n\nc. From <tt>dy\u0101\u0301vap\u1e5bthiv\u012b\u0301</tt> is made the very peculiar genitive <tt>div\u00e1sp\u1e5bthivy\u00f3s</tt> (4 times: AV. has <tt>dy\u0101\u0301v\u0101p\u1e5bthiv\u012b\u0301bhy\u0101m</tt> and <tt>dy\u0101\u0301v\u0101p\u1e5bthivy\u00f3s</tt>).\n\nd. In one compound, <tt>parj\u00e1nyav\u0101\u0301t\u0101</tt>, the first member (RV., once) does not have the dual ending along with the double accent (<tt>indran\u0101saty\u0101</tt>, voc., is doubtful as to accent).

And in one, <tt>indrav\u0101y\u016b\u0301</tt>, form and accent are both accordant with the usages of the later language.\n\ne. Of other copulatives, like those made later, the RV. has the plural <tt>aj\u0101v\u00e1yas</tt>, the duals <tt>\u1e5bks\u0101m\u00e9, saty\u0101n\u1e5bt\u00e9, s\u0101\u00e7an\u0101na\u00e7an\u00e9</tt>; also the neuter collective <tt>i\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101p\u016brt\u00e1m</tt>, and the substantively used neuter of a copulative adjective, <tt>n\u012blalohit\u00e1m</tt>. Further, the neuter plurals <tt>ahor\u0101tr\u0101\u0301\u1e47i</tt> ''nycthemera'', and <tt>ukth\u0101rk\u0101\u0301</tt> ''praises and songs'', of which the final members as independent words are not neuter. No one of these words has more than a single occurrence.\n\n1256. In the later Vedic (AV.), the usage is much more nearly accordant with that of the classical language, save that the class of neuter singular collectives is almost wanting.\n\na. The words with double dual form are only a small minority (a quarter, instead of three quarters, as in RV.); and half of them have only a single accent, on the final: thus, besides those in RV., <tt>bhav\u0101rudr\u0101\u00fa, bhav\u0101\u00e7arv\u0101\u00fa</tt>; <tt>agn\u0101vi\u1e63\u1e47\u016b</tt>, voc., is of anomalous form. The whole number of copulatives is more than double that in RV.\n\nb. The only proper neuter collectives, composed of two nouns, are <tt>ke\u00e7a\u00e7ma\u00e7r\u00fa</tt> ''hair and heard'', <tt>\u0101\u00f1jan\u0101bhya\u00f1jan\u00e1m</tt> ''salve and ointment'', and <tt>ka\u00e7ip\u016bpabarha\u1e47\u00e1m</tt> ''mat and pillow'', unified because of the virtual unity of the two objects specified. Neuter singulars, used in a similar collective way, of adjective compounds, are (besides those in RV.): <tt>k\u1e5bt\u0101k\u1e5bt\u00e1m</tt> ''what is done and undone'' (instead of ''what is done and what is undone''), <tt>citt\u0101k\u016bt\u00e1m</tt> ''thought and desire'', <tt>bhadrap\u0101p\u00e1m</tt> ''good and evil'', <tt>bh\u016btabhavy\u00e1m</tt> ''past and future''.\n\n1257. Copulative compounds composed of adjectives which retain their adjective character are made in the same manner, but are in comparison rare.\n\na. Examples are <tt>\u00e7uklak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a</tt> ''light and dark'', <tt>sthalaj\u0101udaka</tt> ''terrestrial and aquatic'', <tt>d\u0101ntar\u0101jatas\u0101uvar\u1e47a</tt> ''of ivory and silver and gold'', used distributively; and <tt>v\u1e5bttap\u012bna</tt> ''round and plump'', <tt>\u00e7\u0101nt\u0101nuk\u016bla</tt> ''tranquil and propitious'', <tt>h\u1e5b\u1e63itasragrajoh\u012bna</tt> ''wearing fresh garlands and free from dust'', <tt>ni\u1e63ek\u0101di\u00e7ma\u00e7\u0101n\u0101nta</tt> ''beginning with conception and ending with burial'', used cumulatively; <tt>n\u0101 \u2019ti\u00e7\u012bto\u1e63\u1e47a</tt> ''not over cold or hot'', used alternatively; <tt>k\u1e63a\u1e47ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dana\u1e63\u1e6da</tt> ''seen for a moment and then lost'', <tt>cintitopasthita</tt> ''at hand as soon as thought of'', in more pregnant sense.\n\nb. In the Veda, the only examples noted are the cumulative <tt>n\u012blalohit\u00e1</tt> and <tt>i\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101p\u016brt\u00e1</tt> etc., used in the neut. sing. as collectives (as pointed out above), with <tt>t\u0101mradh\u016bmr\u00e1</tt> ''dark tawny;'' and the distributive <tt>dak\u1e63i\u1e47asavy\u00e1</tt> ''right and left'', <tt>saptam\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dam\u00e1</tt> ''seventh and eighth'', and <tt>bhadrap\u0101p\u00e1</tt> ''good and bad'' (beside the corresponding neut. collective). Such combinations as <tt>saty\u0101n\u1e5bt\u00e9</tt> ''truth and falsehood'', <tt>priy\u0101priy\u0101\u0301\u1e47i</tt> ''things''<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"633285":{"pageid":633285,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/516","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>''agreeable and disagreeable'', where each component is used substantively, are, of course, not to be separated from the ordinary noun-compounds.\n\nc.

In accentuated texts, the copulative compounds have uniformly the accent (acute) on the final of the stem.\n\na. Exceptions are a case or two in AV., where doubtless the reading is false: thus, <tt>v\u0101t\u0101parjany\u0101\u0300</tt> (once: beside -<tt>ny\u00e1yos</tt>), <tt>devamanu\u1e63y\u0101\u0300 s</tt> (once: \u00c7B. -<tt>sy\u00e1</tt>), <tt>brahmar\u0101jany\u0101\u0300 bhy\u0101m</tt> (also VS.); further, <tt>v\u0101kopav\u0101ky\u00e0</tt> (\u00c7B.), <tt>a\u00e7an\u0101y\u0101\u0301pip\u0101se</tt> (\u00c7B.).\n\n1259. An example or two are met with of adverbial copulatives: thus, <tt>\u00e1hardivi</tt> ''day by day'', <tt>s\u0101y\u00e1mpr\u0101tar</tt> ''at evening and in the morning''. They have the accent of their prior member. Later occur also <tt>b\u0101hyantar, pratyagdak\u1e63i\u1e47\u0101, pratyagudak</tt>.\n\n1260. Repeated words. In all ages of the language, nouns and pronouns and adjectives and particles are not infrequently repeated, to give an intensive, or a distributive, or a repetitional meaning.\n\na. Though these are not properly copulative compounds, there is no better connection in which to notice them than here. They are, as the older language shows, a sort of compound, of which the prior member has its own independent accent, and the other is without accent: hence they are most suitably and properly written (as in the Vedic pada-texts) as compounds. Thus: <tt>jahy \u00e8\u1e63a\u1e41 v\u00e1ra\u1e41-varam</tt> ''slay of them each beat man;'' <tt>div\u00e9-dive</tt> or <tt>dy\u00e1vi-dyavi</tt> ''from day to day;'' <tt>\u00e1n\u0304g\u0101d-an\u0304g\u0101l l\u00f3mno-lomna\u1e25 p\u00e1rva\u1e47i-parva\u1e47i</tt> ''from every limb, from every hair, in each joint;'' <tt>pr\u00e1-pra yaj\u00f1\u00e1pati\u1e41 tira</tt> ''make the master of the sacrifice live on and on;'' <tt>bh\u016b\u0301yo-bh\u016bya\u1e25 \u00e7v\u00e1\u1e25-\u00e7va\u1e25</tt> ''further and further, tomorrow and again tomorrow;'' <tt>\u00e9kay\u0101i-\u2019kay\u0101</tt> ''with in each case one;'' <tt>vay\u00e1\u1e41-vayam</tt> ''our very selves''.\n\nb. Exceptional and rare cases are those of a personal verb-form repeated: thus, <tt>p\u00edb\u0101-piba</tt> (RV.), <tt>y\u00e1jasva-yajasva</tt> (\u00c7B.), <tt>v\u00e9da-veda</tt> (? \u00c7B.); \u2014 and of two words repeated: thus, <tt>y\u0101\u0301vad v\u0101-y\u0101vad v\u0101</tt> (\u00c7B.), <tt>yatam\u00e9 v\u0101-yatame v\u0101</tt> (\u00c7B.).\n\nc. In a few instances, a word is found used twice in succession without that loss of accent the second time which makes the repetition a virtual composite: thus, <tt>n\u016b\u0301 n\u00fa</tt> (RV.), <tt>s\u00e1\u1e41 s\u00e1m</tt> (AV.), <tt>ih\u00e9 \u2019h\u00e1</tt> (AV.), <tt>an\u00e1y\u0101- \u2019n\u00e1y\u0101</tt> (\u00c7B.), <tt>stuh\u00ed stuh\u00ed</tt> (RV., acc. to pada-text).\n\nd. The class of combinations here described is called by the native grammarians <tt>\u0101mre\u1e0dita</tt> ''added unto'' (?).\n\n1261. Finally may be noticed in passing the compound numerals, <tt>\u00e9k\u0101da\u00e7a</tt> ''11'', <tt>dv\u0101\u0301vi\u1e45\u00e7ati</tt> ''22'', <tt>tr\u00ed\u00e7ata</tt> ''103'', <tt>c\u00e1tu\u1e25sahasra</tt> ''1004'', and so on (476 ff.), as a special and primitive class of copulatives.
