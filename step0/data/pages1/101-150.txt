Before r, the cases are few, and the usage apparently divided: thus, takra, sakra, vakr\u00e1, \u00e7ukr\u00e1, vigr\u00e1, ugr\u00e1, t\u00fagra, m\u1e5bgra, v\u00e1n\u0304kri; but v\u00e1jra and pajr\u00e1 (?).</p>\n\nj. Before v (of the suffixes va, van, vin, etc., and participial v\u0101\u1e45s) the guttural is regularly preserved: thus, \u1e5bkv\u00e1, pakv\u00e1, v\u00e1kva; v\u00e1kvan, \u1e5b\u0301kvan, rikvan, \u00e7ukvan, m\u1e5bgvan, t\u00fagvan, yugvan; \u1e5b\u0301kvant, p\u1e5b\u0301kvant; v\u0101gv\u00edn, vagvan\u00e1, vagvan\u00fa (with further sonant change); vivakv\u0101\u0301\u1e45s, ririkv\u0101\u0301\u1e45s, vivikv\u0101\u0301\u1e45s, rurukv\u0101\u0301\u1e45s, \u00e7u\u00e7ukv\u0101\u0301\u1e45s; \u00e7u\u00e7ukvan\u00e1, \u00e7u\u00e7ukv\u00e1ni: also before the union-vowel i in okiv\u0101\u0301\u1e45s (RV., once). An exception is y\u00e1jvan.\n\nk. The reversion of h in derivation is comparatively rare. The final j which is analogous with \u00e7 (219) shows much less proclivity to reversion than that which corresponds with c.\n\nl. A like reversion shows itself also to some extent in conjugational stem-formation and inflection. Thus, the initial radical becomes guttural after the reduplication in the present or perfect or desiderative or intensive stems, or in derivatives, of the roots ci, cit, ji, hi, han, and in j\u00e1guri (\u221aj\u1e5b); and han becomes ghn on the elision of a (402, 637). The RV. has vivakmi from \u221avac and v\u0101vakre from \u221ava\u00f1c; and SV. has sas\u1e5bgmahe (RV. -s\u1e5bj-). And before ran etc. of 3d pl. mid. we have g for radical j in as\u1e5bgran, as\u1e5bgram, asas\u1e5bgram (all in RV.).\n\n217. Final \u091a\u094d c of a root or stem, if followed in internal combination by any other sound than a vowel or semivowel or nasal, reverts (43) to its original guttural value, and shows everywhere the same form which a \u0915\u094d k would show in the same situation.\n\nThus, v\u00e1kti, uv\u00e1ktha, v\u00e1k\u1e63i, vak\u1e63y\u0101\u0301mi, vaghdi; vh\u0101gbh\u00eds, v\u0101k\u1e63\u00fa; ukt\u00e1, ukth\u00e1, vakt\u00e1r.\n\na. And, as final c becomes k (above 142), the same rule applies also to c in external combination: thus, v\u0101\u0301k ca, v\u0101\u0301g \u00e1pi, v\u0101\u0301n\u0304 me.\n\nExamples of c remaining unchanged in inflection are: ucy\u00e1te, riricr\u00e9, v\u0101c\u00ed, mumucm\u00e1he.\n\n217. Final \u0936\u094d \u00e7 reverts to its original \u0915\u094d k, in internal combination, only before the \u0938\u094d s of a verbal stem or ending (whence, by 180, \u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d k\u1e63); before \u0924\u094d t and \u0925\u094d th, it everywhere becomes \u0937\u094d \u1e63 (whence, by 197, \u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d \u1e63\u1e6d and \u0937\u094d\u0920\u094d \u1e63\u1e6dh); before \u0927\u094d dh, \u092d\u094d bh, and \u0938\u0941 su of the loc. pl., as when final (145), it regularly becomes the lingual mute (\u091f\u094d \u1e6d or \u0921\u094d \u1e0d).\n\nThus, \u00e1vik\u1e63ata, vek\u1e63y\u0101\u0301mi; v\u00e1\u1e63\u1e6di, vi\u1e63\u1e6d\u00e1, d\u00edde\u1e63\u1e0du; didi\u1e0d\u1e0dhi, vi\u1e0dbh\u00eds.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235466":{"pageid":235466,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/102","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>a. But a few roots exhibit the reversions of final \u00e7 to k before bh and su, and also when final (145): they are di\u00e7, d\u1e5b\u00e7, sp\u1e5b\u00e7, and optionally na\u00e7; and vi\u00e7 has in V. always vik\u1e63\u00fa, loc. pl., but v\u00ed\u1e6d, vi\u1e0dbh\u00eds, etc. Examples are d\u00edksa\u1e41\u00e7ita, d\u1e5bgbh\u00eds, h\u1e5bdisp\u1e5b\u0301k, n\u00e1k (or na\u1e6d).</p>\n\nExamples of \u00e7 remaining unchanged before vowels etc. are : vi\u00e7\u00ed, vivi\u00e7y\u0101s, avi\u00e7ran, a\u00e7nomi, vacmi, u\u00e7m\u00e1si.\n\nb. A \u00e7 remains irregularly unchanged before p in the compound vi\u00e7p\u00e1ti.\n\n219. Final \u091c\u094d j is in one set of words treated like \u091a\u094d c, and in another set like \u0936\u094d \u00e7.\n\nThus, from yuj: \u00e1yukth\u0101s, \u00e1yukta, yun\u0304kt\u00e9, yukti, y\u00f3ktra, yok\u1e63y\u0101\u0301mi, yuk\u1e63\u00fa; yun\u0304gdh\u00ed, \u00e1yugdhvam, yugbh\u00eds.\n\nAgain, from m\u1e5bj etc.: \u00e1m\u1e5bk\u1e63at, srak\u1e63y\u0101\u0301mi; m\u0101\u0301r\u1e63\u1e6dhi, m\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u00e1, s\u1e5b\u0301\u1e63\u1e6di, r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dr\u00e1; m\u1e5b\u1e0d\u1e0dh\u00ed, m\u1e5b\u1e0d\u1e0dhav\u00e1m, r\u0101\u1e0dbh\u00eds, r\u0101\u1e6ds\u00fa, r\u0101\u0301\u1e6d.\n\na. To the former or yuj-class belong (as shown by their quotable forms) about twenty roots and radical stems: namely, bhaj, saj, tyaj (not V.), raj 'color'', svaj, majj, nij, tij, vij, 1 and 2 bhuj, yuj, ruj, v\u1e5bj, a\u00f1j, bha\u00f1j, \u00e7i\u00f1j; \u016b\u0301rj, sr\u00e1j, bhi\u1e63\u00e1j, \u00e1s\u1e5bj;\u2014also, stems formed with the suffixes aj and ij (383. IV), as t\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u00e1j, va\u1e47\u00edj; and \u1e5btv\u00edj, though containing the root yaj.\n\nb. To the latter or m\u1e5bj-class belong only about one third as many: namely, yaj, bhrajj, vraj, r\u0101j, bhr\u0101j, m\u1e5bj, s\u1e5bj.\n\nc. A considerable number of j-roots are not placed in circumstances to exhibit the distinction; but such roots are in part assignable to one or the class on the evidence of the related languages. The distinction appears, namely, only when the j occurs as final, or is followed, either in inflection or derivation, by a dental mute (t, th, dh), or, in noun-inflection, by bh or su. In derivation (above, 216) we find a g sometimes from the m\u1e5bj-class: thus m\u0101rga, s\u00e1rga, etc.; and (2161) before Vedic mid. endings, sas\u1e5bgmahe, as\u1e5bgran, etc. (beside sas\u1e5bjrire)\u2014while from the yuj-class occur only yuyujre, ayujran, bubhujrire, with j. And MS. has vi\u00e7vas\u1e5b\u0301k from (\u221as\u1e5bj).\n\n220. Final ch falls under the rules of combination almost only in the root prach, in which it is treated as if it were \u00e7 (pra\u00e7 being, indeed, its more original form): thus, prak\u1e63y\u0101\u0301mi, p\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u00e1, and also the derivative pra\u00e7n\u00e1. As final and in noun-inflection (before bh and su), it is changed to the lingual mute: thus, pr\u0101\u1e0dviv\u0101ka.\n\na. M\u016brt\u00e1 is called the participle of m\u016brch, and a gerund m\u016brtv\u0101\u0301 is given to the same root. They (with m\u016b\u0301rti) must doubtless come from a simpler form of the root.\n\nb. Of jh there is no occurrence: the grammarians require it to be treated like c.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235467":{"pageid":235467,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/103","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>221. The compound k\u1e63 is not infrequent as final of a root (generally of demonstrably secondary origin), or of a tense-stem (s-aorist: see below, 878 ff.); and, in the not very frequent cases of its internal combination, it is treated as if a single sound, following the rules for \u00e7: thus \u00e7\u00e1k\u1e63e (cak\u1e63 + se), c\u00e1k\u1e63va; c\u00e1\u1e63\u1e6de, \u00e1ca\u1e63\u1e6da, \u00e1sr\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dam, \u00e1s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da, tv\u00e1\u1e63\u1e6dar. As to its treatment when final, see 146.</p>\n\na. Thus, we are taught by the grammarians to make such forms as gor\u00e1\u1e6d, gor\u00e1\u1e0dbhis, gor\u00e1\u1e6d\u1e63u (from gor\u00e1k\u1e63); and we actually have \u1e63\u00e1\u1e6d, \u1e63a\u1e0dbh\u00eds, \u1e63a\u1e6ds\u00fa from \u1e63ak\u1e63 or \u1e63a\u1e63 (146 b). For jagdha etc. from \u221ajak\u1e63, see 233 f.\n\nb. In the single anomalous root vra\u00e7c, the compound \u00e7c is said to follow the rules for simple \u00e7. From it are quotable the future vrak\u1e63y\u00e1ti, the gerunds v\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101\u0301  (AV.) and v\u1e5bktv\u012b\u0301 (RV.), and the participle (957 c) v\u1e5bk\u1e47\u00e1. Its c reverts to k in the derivative vraska.\n\n222. The roots in final \u0939\u094d h, like those in \u091c\u094d j, fall into two classes, exhibiting a similar diversity of treatment, appearing in the same kinds of combination.\n\na. In the one class, as duh, we have a reversion of h (as of c) to a guttural form, and its treatment as if it were still its original gh: thus, \u00e1dhuk\u1e63am, dhok\u1e63y\u0101\u0301mi; dugdh\u0101\u0301m, dugdh\u00e1; \u00e1dhok, dh\u00fak, dhugbh\u00eds, dhuk\u1e63\u00fa.\n\nb. In the other cases, as ruh and sah, we have a guttural reversion (as of \u00e7) only before s in verb-formations and derivation: thus, \u00e1ruk\u1e63at, rok\u1e63y\u0101\u0301mi, s\u0101k\u1e63iy\u00e1, sak\u1e63\u00e1\u1e47i. As final, in external combination, and in noun-inflection before bh and su, the h (like \u00e7) becomes a lingual mute: thus, tur\u0101\u1e63\u0101\u0301\u1e6d, p\u1e5btan\u0101\u1e63\u0101\u0301\u1e0d ayodhy\u00e1\u1e25, tur\u0101s\u0101\u0301\u1e0dbhis, tur\u0101s\u0101\u0301\u1e6dsu. But before a dental mute (t, th, dh) in verb-inflection and in derivation, its euphonic effect is peculiarly complicated: in turns the dental into a lingual (as would \u00e7); but it also makes it sonant and aspirate (as would \u1e0dh: see 160); and further, it disappears itself, and the preceding vowel, if short, is lengthened: thus, from ruh with ta comes r\u016b\u1e0dh\u00e1, from leh with ti comes l\u00e9\u1e0dhi, from guh with tar comes g\u016b\u1e0dh\u00e1r, from meh with tum comes m\u00e9\u1e0dhum, from lih with tas or thas comes l\u012b\u1e0dh\u00e1s, from lih with dhvam comes l\u012b\u1e0dhv\u00e1m, etc.\n\nc. This is as if we had to assume as transition sound a sonant aspirate lingual sibilant \u1e63h, with the euphonic effects of a lingual and of a sonant aspirate (160), itself disappearing under the law of the existing language which admits no sonant sibilant.\n\n223. The roots of the two classes, as shown in their forms found in use, are:\n\na. of the first or duh-class: dah, dih, duh, druh, snuh, snih (and the final of u\u1e63\u1e47\u00edh is similarly treated);<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235468":{"pageid":235468,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/104","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>b. of the second or ruh-class: vah, sah, mih, rih or lih, guh, ruh, d\u1e5b\u1e45h, t\u1e5b\u1e45h, b\u1e5bh, ba\u1e45h, sp\u1e5bh (?).</p>\n\nc. But muh forms also (not in RV.) the participle m\u016b\u1e0dha and agent-noun m\u016b\u1e0dh\u00e1r, as well as mugdh\u00e1 and mugdh\u00e1r; and druh and snih are allowed by the grammarians to do likewise: such forms as dr\u016b\u1e0dha and sn\u012b\u1e0dha, however, have not been met with in use.\n\nd. From roots of the ruh-class we find also in the Veda the forms gart\u0101r\u00fak, nom. sing., and pr\u0101\u1e47adh\u1e5b\u0301k and dadh\u1e5b\u0301k; and hence purusp\u1e5b\u0301k (the only occurrence) does not certainly prove \u221asp\u1e5bh to be of the duh-class.\n\ne. A number of other h-roots are not proved by their occurring forms to belong to either class; they, too, are with more or less confidence assigned to the one or the other by comparison with the related languages.\n\nf. In derivation, before certain suffixes (216), we have gh instead of h from verbs of either class.\n\ng. The root nah comes from original dh instead of gh, and its reversion is accordingly to a dental mute: thus, natsy\u0101\u0301mi, naddh\u00e1, up\u0101n\u00e1dbhis, up\u0101nadyuga, anup\u0101natka. So also the root grah comes from (early Vedic) grabh, and shows labials in many forms and derivatives (though it is assimilated to other h-roots in the desiderative stem jigh\u1e5bk\u1e63a). In like manner, h is used for dh in some of the forms and derivatives of \u221adv\u0101 ''put''; and further analogous facts are the stem kakuh\u00e1 beside kakubh\u00e1, the double imperative ending dhi and hi, and the dative m\u00e1hyam beside t\u00fabhyam (491).\n\n224. Irregularities of combination are:\n\na. The vowel \u1e5b is not lengthened after the loss of the h-element: thus, d\u1e5b\u1e0dh\u00e1, t\u1e5b\u1e0dh\u00e1, b\u1e5b\u1e0dh\u00e1 (the only cases; and in the Veda their first syllable has metrical value as heavy or long).\n\nb. The roots vah and sah change their vowel to o instead of lengthening it: thus, vo\u1e0dh\u00e1m, vo\u1e0dh\u0101\u0301m, vo\u1e0dh\u00e1r, s\u00f3\u1e0dhum. But from sah in the older language forms with \u0101 are more frequent: thus, s\u0101\u1e0dh\u00e1, \u00e1\u1e63\u0101\u1e0dha (also later), s\u0101\u0301\u1e0dhar. The root t\u1e5b\u1e45h changes the vowel of its class-sign na into e instead of lengthening it: thus, t\u1e5b\u1e47e\u1e0dhi, t\u1e5b\u1e47\u00e9\u1e0dhu, at\u1e5b\u1e47et (the grammarians teach also t\u1e5b\u1e47ehmi and t\u1e5b\u1e47ek\u1e63i: but no such forms are quotable, and, if ever actually in use, they must have been made by false analogy with others).\n\nc. These anomalous vowel-changes seem to stand in connection with the fact that the cases showing them are the only ones where other than an alterant vowel (180) comes before the lingualized sibilant representative of the h. Compare \u1e63\u00f3\u1e0da\u00e7a etc.\n\nd. Apparently by dissimilation, the final of vah in anomalous compound ana\u1e0dvah is changed to d instead of \u1e0d: see 404.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235469":{"pageid":235469,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/105","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><center>The lingual sibilant \u0937\u094d \u1e63.</center>\n\n225. Since the lingual sibilant, in its usual and normal occurrences, is (182) the product of lingualization of s after certain alterant sounds, we might expect final radical \u1e63, when (in rare cases) it comes to stand where a \u1e63 cannot maintain itself, to revert to its original, and be treated as a s would be treated under the same circumstances. That, however, is true only in a very few instances.\n\na. Namely, in the prefix dus (evidently identical with \u221adu\u1e63); in saj\u016b\u0301s (adverbially used case-form from \u221aju\u1e63); in (RV.) viv\u00e9s and \u00e1vives, from \u221avi\u1e63; in \u0101\u00edyes (RV.), from \u221a\u012b\u1e63; and in \u0101\u00e7\u00eds, from \u00e7i\u1e63 as secondary form of \u221a\u00e7\u0101s. All these, except the first two, are more or less open in question.\n\n226. In general, final lingual \u0937\u094d \u1e63, in internal combination, is treated in the same manner as palatal \u0936\u094d \u00e7. Thus:\n\na. Before t and th it remains unchanged, and the latter are assimilated: e.g. dvi\u1e63\u1e6das, dvi\u1e63\u1e6dhas, dv\u00e9\u1e63\u1e6dum.\n\nThis is a common and perfectly natural combination.\n\nb. Before dh, bh, and su, as also in external combination (145), it becomes a lingual mute: and dh is made lingual after it: e.g. pi\u1e47\u1e0d\u1e0dhi, vi\u1e0d\u1e0dhi, vivi\u1e0d\u1e0dhi, dvi\u1e0d\u1e0dhvam, dvi\u1e0dbh\u00eds, dvi\u1e6ds\u00fa; bhinnavi\u1e6dka.\n\nc. So also the dh of dhvam as ending of 2d pl. mid. becomes \u1e0dh after final \u1e63 of a tense-stem, whether the \u1e63 be regarded as lost or as converted to \u1e0d before it (the manuscripts write simply \u1e0dhv, not \u1e0d\u1e0dhv; but this is ambiguous: see 232). Thus, after \u1e63 of s-aorist stems (881 a), asto\u1e0dhvam, av\u1e5b\u1e0dhvam, cyo\u1e0dhvam (the only quotable cases), from asto\u1e63 + dhvam etc.; but ar\u0101dhvam from ar\u0101s + dhvam. Further, after the \u1e63 of i\u1e63-aorist stems (901 a), \u0101indhi\u1e0dhvam, arti\u1e0dhvam, ajani\u1e0dhvam, vepi\u1e0dhvam (the only quotable cases), from ajani\u1e63 + dhvam etc. Yet again, in the precative (924), as bhavi\u1e63\u012b\u1e0dhvam, if, as is probable (unfortunately, no example of this person is quotable from any part of the literature), the precative-sign s (\u1e63) is to be regarded as present in the form. According, however, to the Hindu grammarians, the use of \u1e0dh or of dh in the i\u1e63-aorist and precative depends on whether the i of i\u1e63 or of i\u1e63\u012b is or is not \u201cpreceded by a semivowel or h\u201d\u2014which both in itself appears senseless and is opposed to the evidence of all the quotable forms. Moreover, the same authorities prescribed the change of dh to \u1e0dh under the same restriction as to circumstances, in the perf. mid. ending dhve also: in this case, too, without any conceivable reason; and no example of \u1e0dhve in the 2d pl. perf. has been pointed out in the literature.\n\nd. The conversion of \u1e63 to \u1e6d (or \u1e0d) as final and before bh and su is parallel with the like conversion of \u00e7, and of j and h in the m\u1e5bj and<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235470":{"pageid":235470,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/106","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>ruh classes of roots, and perhaps with the occasional change of s to t (167\u20138). It is a very infrequent case, occurring (save as it may be assumed in the case of \u1e63a\u1e63) only once in the RV. and once in the AV. (-dvi\u1e6d and -pru\u1e6d), although those texts have more than 40 roots with final \u1e63; in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, moreover, have been noticed further only -pru\u1e6d and v\u00ed\u1e6d (\u00c7B.), and -\u00e7li\u1e6d (K.). From pi\u1e45\u1e63, RV. has the anomalous form pi\u1e47ak (2d and 3d sing., for pina\u1e63-s and pina\u1e63-t).\n\ne. Before s in internal combination (except su of loc. pl.) it becomes k: thus, dv\u00e9k\u1e63i, dvek\u1e63y\u0101\u0301mi, \u00e1dvik\u1e63am.\n\nf. This change is of anomalous phonetic character, and difficult of explanation. It is also practically of very rare occurrence. The only RV. examples (apart from pi\u1e47ak, above) are vivek\u1e63i, from \u221avi\u1e63, and the desid. stem ririk\u1e63a from \u221ari\u1e63; AV. has only dvik\u1e63at and dvik\u1e63ata, and the desid. stem \u00e7i\u00e7lik\u1e63a from \u221a\u00e7li\u1e63. Other examples are quotable from \u221a\u221ak\u1e5b\u1e63 and pi\u1e63 and vi\u1e63 (\u00c7B. etc.), and \u00e7i\u1e63 (\u00c7B.); and they are by the Hindu grammarians prescribed to be formed from about half-a-dozen other roots.\n\n<center>Extension and Abbreviation.</center>\n\n227. As a general rule, ch is not allowed by the grammarians to stand in that form after a vowel, but is to be doubled, becoming cch (which the manuscripts sometimes write chch).\n\na. The various authorities disagree with one another in detail as to this duplication. According to P\u0101\u1e47ini, ch is doubled within a word after either a long or a short vowel; and, as initial, necessarily after a short and after the particles \u0101\u0301 and m\u0101\u0301, and optionally everywhere after a long. In RV., initial ch is doubled after a long vowel of \u0101\u0301 only, and certain special cases after a short vowel are excepted. For the required usage in the other Vedic texts, see their several Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas. The K\u0101\u1e6dhaka writes for original ch (not ch from combination of t or n with \u00e7: 203) after a vowel everywhere \u00e7ch. The manuscripts in general write simple ch.\n\nb. Opinions are still at variance as to how far this duplication has an etymological ground, and how far it is only an acknowledgment of the fact that ch makes a heavy syllable even after a short vowel (makes \u201cposition\u201d: 79). As the duplication is accepted and followed by most European scholars, it will be also adopted in this work in words and sentences (not in roots and stems).\n\n228. After r, any consonant (save a spirant before a vowel) is by the grammarians either allowed or required to be doubled (an aspirate, by prefixing the corresponding non-aspirate: 154).\n\nThus:\n\n\u0905\u0930\u094d\u0915 arka, or \u0905\u0930\u094d\u0915\u094d\u0915 arkka; \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f k\u0101rya, or \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094d\u092f k\u0101ryya;\n\n\u0905\u0930\u094d\u0925 artha, or \u0905\u0930\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0925 arttha; \u0926\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0918 d\u012brgha, or \u0926\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0917\u094d\u0918 d\u012brggha.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235471":{"pageid":235471,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/107","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>a. Some of the authorities include, along with r, also h or l or v, or more than one of them, in this rule.</p>\n\nb. A doubled consonant after r is very common in manuscripts and inscriptions, as also in native text-editions and in the earlier editions prepared by European scholars\u2014in later ones, the duplication is universally omitted.\n\nc. On the other hand, the manuscripts often write a single consonant after r where a double one is etymologically required: thus, k\u0101rtikeya, v\u0101rtika, for ka\u0101rttikeya, v\u0101rttika.\n\n229. The first consonant of a group\u2014whether interior, or initial after a vowel of a preceding word\u2014is by the grammarians either allowed or required to be doubled.\n\na. This duplication is allowed by P\u0101\u1e47ini and required by the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas\u2014in both, with mention of authorities who deny it altogether. For certain exceptions, see the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas; the meaning of the whole matter is too obscure to justify the giving of details here.\n\n230. Other cases of extension of consonant-groups, required by some of the grammatical authorities, are the following:\n\na. Between a non-nasal and a nasal mute, the insertion of so-called yamas (''twins''), or nasal counterparts, is taught by the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas (and assumed in P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s commentary): see APr. i. 99, note.\n\nb. Between h and a following nasal mute the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas teach the insertion of a nasal sound called a n\u0101sikya: see APr. i. 100, note.\n\nc. Between r and a following nasal consonant the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas teach the insertion of a svarabhakti or ''vowel-fragment'': see APr. i. 101\u20132, note.\n\nd. Some authorities assume this insertion only before a spirant; the others regard it as twice as long before a spirant as before any other consonant\u2014namely, a half or a quarter ''mora'' before the former, a quarter or an eight before the latter. One (VPr.) admits it after l as well as r. It is variously described as a fragment of the vowel a or of \u1e5b (or \u1e37).\n\ne. The RPr. puts a svarabhakti also between a sonant consonant and a following mute or spirant; and APr. introduces an element called spho\u1e6dana (''distinguisher'') between a guttural and a preceding mute of another class.\n\nf. For one or two other cases of yet more doubtful value, see the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas.\n\n231. After a nasal, the former of two non-nasal mutes may be dropped, whether homogeneous only with the nasal, or with both: thus, yun\u0304dh\u00ed for yun\u0304gdh\u00ed, yun\u0304dhv\u00e1m for yun\u0304gdhv\u00e1m, \u0101n\u0304t\u00e1m for \u0101n\u0304kt\u00e1m, pan\u0304t\u00ed for pan\u0304kt\u00ed, chint\u0101\u0301m for chintt\u0101\u0301m, bhinth\u00e1 for bhintth\u00e1, indh\u00e9 for inddh\u00e9.\n\na. The abbreviation, allowed by P\u0101\u1e47ini, is required by APr. (the other Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas take no notice of it). It is the more usual practice of the manuscripts, though the full group is also often written.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235472":{"pageid":235472,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/108","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>232. In general, a double mute (including an aspirate which is doubled by the prefixion of a non-aspirate) in combination with any other consonant is by the manuscripts written as simple.</p>\n\na. That is to say, the ordinary usage of the manuscripts makes no difference between those groups in which a phonetic duplication is allowed by the rules given above (228, 229) and those in which the duplication is etymological. As every tv after a vowel may also be properly written ttv, so dattv\u0101\u0301 and tattv\u00e1 may be, and almost invariably are, written as datv\u0101\u0301 and tatv\u00e1. As k\u00e1rtana is also properly k\u00e1rttana, so k\u0101rttika (from k\u1e5btti) is written as k\u0101rtika. So in inflection, we have always, for example, maj\u00f1\u0101\u0301 etc., not majj\u00f1\u0101\u0301, from majj\u00e1n. Even in composition and sentence-collocation the same abbreviations are made: thus, h\u1e5bdyot\u00e1 for h\u1e5bddyot\u00e1; chin\u00e1ty asya for chin\u00e1tty asya. Hence it is impossible to determine by the evidence of written usage whether we should regard \u0101dhvam or \u0101ddhvam (from \u221a\u0101s), \u00e1dvi\u1e0dhvam or \u00e1dvi\u1e0d\u1e0dhvam (from \u221advi\u1e63), as the true form of a second person plural.\n\n233. a. Instances are sometimes met with of apparent loss (perhaps after conversion to a semivowel) of i or u before y or v respectively. Thus, in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, t\u00fa and n\u00fa with following v\u0101\u00ed etc. often made tv\u0101\u00ed, nv\u0101\u00ed (also tv\u0101\u0301v\u00e1, \u00e1nv\u0101\u00ed); and other examples from the older language are anvart- (anu + \u221avart); paryan, paryanti, pary\u0101y\u0101t, pary\u0101\u1e47a (pari + yan, etc.); abhy\u00e0rti (abhi + iyarti); antary\u0101t (antar + iy\u0101t); c\u0101rv\u0101c, c\u0101rv\u0101ka, c\u0101rvadana (c\u0101ru + v\u0101c, etc.); ky\u00e0nt for k\u00edyant; dvyoga (dvi + yoga); anv\u0101, anv\u0101sana (anu + v\u0101, etc.); probably vy\u00f9noti for v\u00ed yunoti (RV.), urv\u00e1\u00e7\u012b (uru-va\u00e7\u012b), \u00e7\u00ed\u00e7var\u012b for \u00e7\u00ed\u00e7u-var\u012b (RV.); vy\u0101m\u00e1 (vi + y\u0101ma); and the late svar\u1e47a for suvar\u1e47a. More anomalous abbreviations are the common t\u1e5bc\u00e1 (tri + \u1e5bca); and dv\u1e5bca (dvi + \u1e5bca: S.) and tre\u1e47\u012b (tri + e\u1e47\u012b: \u0100past.).\n\nFurther, certain cases of the loss of a sibilant require notice. Thus:\n\nb. According to the Hindu grammarians, the s of s-aorist stems is lost after a short vowel in the 2d and 3d sing. middle: thus, adith\u0101s and adita (1st sing. adi\u1e63i), ak\u1e5bth\u0101s and ak\u1e5bta (1st sing. ak\u1e5b\u1e63i). It is, however, probably that such cases are to be explained in a different manner: see 834 a.\n\nc. The s between two mutes is lost in all combinations of the roots sth\u0101 and stambh with the prefix ud: thus, \u00fat thus, \u00fatthita, \u00fat th\u0101paya, \u00fattabdha, etc.\n\nd. The same omission is now and then made in other similar cases: thus cit k\u00e1mbhanena (for sk\u00e1mbh-: RV.); tasm\u0101t tute (for stute) and puroruk tuta (for stuta: K.); the compounds \u1e5bkth\u0101 (\u1e5bk + sth\u0101: PB.) and utphulin\u0304ga; the derivative utph\u0101la (\u221asphal). On the other hand, we may have vidy\u00fat stan\u00e1yant\u012b (RV.), utsthala, kakutstha, etc.\n\ne. So also the tense-sign of the s-aorist is lost after a final consonant of a root before the initial consonant of an ending: thus, ach\u0101ntta<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235473":{"pageid":235473,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/109","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>(and for this, by 231, ach\u0101nta) for ach\u0101ntsta, \u00e7\u0101pta for \u00e7\u0101psta, t\u0101ptam for t\u0101pstam, abh\u0101kta for abh\u0101ksta, am\u0101uktam for am\u0101ukstam. These are the only quotable cases: compare 883.\n\nf. A final s of root or tense-stem is in a few instances lost after a sonant aspirate, and the combination of mutes is then made as if no sibilant had ever intervened. Thus, from the root ghas, with omission of the vowel and then of the final sibilant, we have the form gdha (for ghs-ta: 3d sing. mid.), the participle gdha (in agdh\u0101\u0301d), and the derivative ghdi (for ghs-ti; in s\u00e1-gdhi); and further, from the reduplicated form of the same root, or \u221ajak\u1e63, we have jagdha, jagdhum, jagdhv\u0101, jagdhi (from jaghs-ta etc.); also, in like manner, from baps, reduplication of bhas, the form babdh\u0101m (for babhs-t\u0101m). According to the Hindu grammarians, the same utter loss of the aorist-sign s takes place after a final sonant aspirate of a root before an ending beginning with t or th: thus, from \u221arudh, s-aorist stem ar\u0101uts act. and aruts mid., come the active dual and plural persons ar\u0101uddham and ar\u0101uddh\u0101m and ar\u0101uddha, and the middle singular persons aruddh\u0101s and aruddha. None of the active forms, however, have been found quotable from the literature, ancient or modern; and the middle forms admit also of a different explanation: see 834, 883.\n\n<center>Strengthening and Weakening Processes.</center>\n\n234. Under this head, we take up first the changes that affect vowels, and then those that affect consonants\u2014adding for convenience\u2019s sake, in each case, a brief notice of the vowel and consonant elements that have come to bear the apparent office of connectives.\n\n<center>Gu\u1e47a and V\u1e5bddhi.</center>\n\n255. The so-called gu\u1e47a and v\u1e5bddhi-changes are the most regular and frequent of vowel-changes, being of constant occurrence both in inflection and in derivation.\n\na. A gu\u1e47a-vowel (gu\u1e47a ''secondary quality'') differs from the corresponding simple vowel by a prefixed a-element which is combined with the other according to the usual rules; a v\u1e5bddhi-vowel (v\u1e5bddhi ''growth, increment''), by the further prefixion of a to the gu\u1e47a-vowel. Thus, of \u0907 i or \u0908 \u012b the corresponding gu\u1e47a is (a+i=) \u090f e; the corresponding v\u1e5bddhi is (a+e=) \u0910 \u0101i. But in all gunating processes \u0905 a remains unchanged\u2014or, as it is sometimes expressed,<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235474":{"pageid":235474,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/110","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>\u0905 a is its own gu\u1e47a; \u0906 \u0101, of course, remains unchanged for both gu\u1e47a and v\u1e5bddhi.\n\n236. The series of corresponding degrees is then as follows:\n<div align=\"center\">\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n!|simple vowel\n|a \u0101\n|i \u012b\n|u \u016b\n|\u1e5b\n|\u1e37\n|-\n!|gu\u1e47a\n|a \u0101\n|e\n|o\n|ar\n|al\n|-\n!|v\u1e5bddhi\n|\u0101\n|\u0101i\n|\u0101u\n|\u0101r\n|}\n</div >\na. There is nowhere any occurrence of \u1e5d in a situation to undergo either gu\u1e47a or v\u1e5bddhi-change; nor does \u1e37 (26) ever suffer change to v\u1e5bddhi. Theoretically, \u1e5d would have the same changes as \u1e5b; and the v\u1e5bddhi of \u1e37 would be \u0101l.\n\nb. In secondary derivatives requiring v\u1e5bddhi of the first syllable (1204), the o of go (361 c) is strengthened to g\u0101u: thus, g\u0101umata, g\u0101u\u1e63\u1e6dhika.\n\n237. The historical relations of the members of each vowel-series are still matters of some difference of opinion. From the special point of view of the Sanskrit, the simple vowels wear the aspect of being in general the original or fundamental ones, and the others of being products of their increment or strengthening, in two several degrees\u2014so that the rules of formation direct a, i, u, \u1e5b, \u1e37 to be raised to gu\u1e47a or v\u1e5bddhi respectively, under specified conditions. But \u1e5b has long been so clearly seen to come by abbreviation or weakening from an earlier ar (or ra) that many European grammarians have preferred to treat the gu\u1e47a-forms as the original and the other as the derivative. Thus, for example: instead of assuming certain roots to be bh\u1e5b and v\u1e5bdh, and making from them bharati and vardhati, and bh\u1e5bta and v\u1e5bddha, by the same rules from which bh\u016b and n\u012b and from budh and cit form bhavati and nayati, bodhati, and cetati, bh\u016bta and n\u012bta, buddha and citta\u2014they assume bhar and vardh to be the roots, and give the rules of formation for them in reverse. In this work, as already stated (104 e), the \u1e5b-form is preferred.\n\n238. The gu\u1e47a-increment is an Indo-European phenomenon, and is in many cases seen to occur in connection with an accent on the increased syllable. It is found\u2014\n\na. In root-syllables: either in inflection, as dv\u00e9\u1e63\u1e6di from \u221advi\u1e63, d\u00f3hmi from \u221aduh; or in derivation, as dv\u00e9\u1e63a, d\u00f3has, dv\u00e9\u1e63\u1e6dum, d\u00f3gdhum.\n\nb. In formative elements: either conjugational class-signs, as tan\u00f3mi from tanu; or suffixes of derivation, in inflection or in further derivation, as mat\u00e1ye from mat\u00ed, bh\u0101n\u00e1vas from bh\u0101n\u00fa, pit\u00e1ram from pit\u1e5b\u0301 (or pit\u00e1r), hantavy\u00e0 from h\u00e1ntu.\n\n239.

A few cases occur of prolongation instead of increment; thus, d\u016b\u1e63\u00e1yati from \u221adu\u1e63, g\u016b\u0301hati from \u221aguh.\n\nThe changes of \u1e5b (more original ar or ra) are so various as to call for further description.\n\n241. The increments of \u1e5b are sometimes ra and r\u0101, instead of ar and \u0101r: namely, especially, where by such reversal a difficult combination of consonants is avoided: thus, from \u221ad\u1e5b\u00e7, drak\u1e63y\u0101\u0301mi and \u00e1dr\u0101k\u1e63am; but also p\u1e5bth\u00fa and prath, p\u1e5bch and prach, k\u1e5bp\u0101\u0301 and \u00e1krapi\u1e63\u1e6da.\n\n242. In a number of roots (about a dozen quotable ones) ending in \u1e5b (for more original ar), the \u1e5b changes both with ar, and more irregularly, in a part of the forms, with ir\u2014or also with ur (especially after a labial, in p\u1e5b, m\u1e5b, v\u1e5b, sporadically in others): which ir and ur, again, are liable to prolongation into \u012br and \u016br. Thus, for example, from t\u1e5b (or tar), we have tarati, titarti, tat\u0101ra, at\u0101ri\u1e63am, by regular processes; but also tirati, t\u012bryati, t\u012brtv\u0101, -t\u012brya, t\u012br\u1e47a, and even (V.) tury\u0101ma, tutury\u0101t, tartur\u0101\u1e47a. The treatment of such roots has to be described in speaking of each formation.\n\na. For the purpose of artificially indicating this peculiarity of treatment, such roots are by the Hindu grammarians written with long \u1e5d, or with both r and \u1e5d: no \u1e5d actually appears anywhere among their forms.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235476":{"pageid":235476,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/112","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>b. The (quotable) \u1e5d-roots are 2 k\u1e5b ''strew'', 1 g\u1e5b ''sing'', 2 g\u1e5b ''swallow'', 1 j\u1e5b ''wear out'', t\u1e5b, 1 \u00e7\u1e5b ''crush''.</p>\n\nc. The (quotable) \u1e5b and \u1e5d-roots are \u1e5b, 1 d\u1e5b ''pierce'', 1 p\u1e5b ''fill'', 1 m\u1e5b ''die'', 2 v\u1e5b ''choose'', st\u1e5b , hv\u1e5b.\n\nd. Forms analogous with these are sometimes made also from other roots: thus, c\u012br\u1e47a, c\u012brtv\u0101, carc\u016bry\u00e1, from \u221acar; sp\u016brdh\u00e1n and sp\u016brdh\u00e1se from \u221asp\u1e5bdh.\n\n243. In a few cases \u1e5b comes from the contraction of other syllables than ar and ra: thus, in t\u1e5bta and t\u1e5bt\u012bva, from ri; in \u00e7\u1e5b\u1e47u, from ru; in bh\u1e5bk\u016b\u1e6di, from r\u016b.\n\n<center>Vowel-lengthening.</center>\n\n244. Vowel-lengthening concerns especially i and u, since lengthening of a is in part (except where in evident analogy with that of i and u) indistinguishable from its increment, and \u1e5b is made long only in certain plural cases of stems in \u1e5b (or ar: 369 ff.). Lengthening is a much more irregular and sporadic change than increment, and its cases will in general be left to be pointed out in connection with the processes of inflection and derivation: a few only will be mentioned here.\n\n245. a. Final radical i and u are especially liable to prolongation before y: as in passive and gerund and so on.\n\nb. Final radical ir and ur (from variable \u1e5b-roots: 242) are liable to prolongation before all consonants except those of personal endings: namely, before y and tv\u0101 and na: and in declensions before bh and s (392). Radical is has the same prolongation in declension (392).\n\n246. Compensatory lengthening, or absorption by a vowel of the time of a lost following consonant, is by no means common. Certain instances of it have been pointed out above (179, 198 c, d, 199 d, 222 b). Perhaps such cases as pit\u0101 for pitars (371 a) and dhan\u012b for dhanins (439) are to be classed here.\n\n247. The final vowel of a former member of a compound is often made long, especially in the Veda. Prolongations of final a, and before v, are most frequent; but cases are found of every variety. Examples are: dev\u0101v\u012b\u0301, vayun\u0101v\u00edd, pr\u0101v\u1e5b\u0301\u1e63, \u1e5bt\u0101vasu, \u00edndr\u0101vant, sadan\u0101s\u00e1d, \u00e7at\u0101\u0301magha, vi\u00e7v\u0101\u0301nara, \u00e9k\u0101da\u00e7a; ap\u012bj\u016b\u0301, par\u012b\u1e47\u00e1h, v\u012br\u00fadh, tuv\u012bmagh\u00e1, tv\u00ed\u1e63\u012bmant, \u00e7\u00e1kt\u012bvant; vas\u016bj\u016b\u0301, an\u016br\u00fadh, s\u016bm\u00e1ya, pur\u016bv\u00e1su.\n\n248. In the Veda, the final vowel of a word\u2014generally a, much less often i and u\u2014is in a large number of cases prolonged. Usually the prolongation takes place where it is favored by the metre, but sometimes even where the metre opposes the change (for details, see the various Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas).\n\nWords of which the finals are thus treated are:<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235477":{"pageid":235477,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/113","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>a.

The alteration of short a to an i- or u-vowel in the formative processes of the language, except in \u1e5b or ar roots (as explained above), is a sporadic phenomenon only.\n\n250. But the lightening of a long \u0101 especially to an i-vowel (as also its loss), is a frequent process; no other vowel is so unstable.\n\na. Of the class-sign n\u0101 (of the kr\u012b-class of verbs: 717 ff.), the \u0101 is in weak forms changed to \u012b, and before vowel-endings dropped altogether. The final \u0101 of certain roots is treated in the same manner: thus, m\u0101, h\u0101, etc. (662\u20136). And from some roots, \u0101- and \u012b- or i-forms so interchange that it is difficult to classify them or to determine the true character of the root.\n\nb. Radical \u0101 is weakened to the semblance of the union-vowel i in certain verbal forms: as perfect dadima from \u221ad\u0101 etc. (794 k); aorist adhith\u0101s from \u221adh\u0101 etc. (834 a); present jahimas from \u221ah\u0101 etc. (665).\n\nc. Radical \u0101 is shortened to the semblance of stem-a in a number reduplicated forms, as ti\u1e63\u1e6da, piba, dada, etc.: see 671\u20134; also in a few aorists, as \u00e1hvam, \u00e1khyam, etc.: see 847.\n\nd. Radical \u0101 sometimes becomes e, especially before y: as sthey\u0101sam, deya.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235478":{"pageid":235478,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/114","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>251. Certain \u0101-roots, because of their peculiar exchanges with \u012b and i-forms, especially in forming the present stem, are given by the Hindu grammarians as roots ending in e or \u0101i or o. Thus, from 2 dh\u0101 ''suck'' (dhe) come the present dh\u00e1yati and participle and gerund dh\u012bt\u00e1, dh\u012btv\u0101\u0301; the other forms are made from dh\u0101, as dadhus, adh\u0101t, dh\u0101syati, dh\u0101\u0301tave, dh\u0101payati. From 2 g\u0101 ''sing'' (g\u0101i) come the present g\u0101\u0301yati, the participle and gerund g\u012bt\u00e1 and g\u012btv\u0101\u0301, and passive g\u012by\u00e1te, and the other forms from g\u0101. From 3 d\u0101 ''cut'' (do) come the present dy\u00e1ti and participle dit\u00e1 or din\u00e1, and the other forms from d\u0101. The irregularities of these roots will be treated below, under the various formations (see especially 761 d ff.).</p>\n\n252. By a process of abbreviation essentially akin with that of ar or ra to \u1e5b, the va (usually initial) of a number of roots becomes u, and the ya of a much smaller number becomes i, in certain verbal forms and derivatives. Thus, from vac comes uv\u0101\u0301ca, ucy\u0101\u0301sam, uktv\u0101\u0301, ukt\u00e1, ukt\u00ed, ukth\u00e1, etc.; from yaj come iy\u0101\u0301ja, ijy\u0101\u0301sam, i\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101\u0301, i\u1e63\u1e6d\u00e1, \u00ed\u1e63\u1e6di, etc. See below, under the various formations.\n\na. To this change is given by European grammarians the name of sampras\u0101ra\u1e47a, by adaptation of a term used in the native grammar.\n\n253. A short a, of root or ending, is not infrequently lost between consonants in a weakened syllable: thus, in verb-forms, ghn\u00e1nti, \u00e1paptam, jagm\u00fas, jaj\u00f1\u00fas, \u00e1j\u00f1ata; in noun-forms, r\u0101\u0301j\u00f1e, r\u0101\u0301j\u00f1\u012b.\n\n254. Union-vowels. All the simple vowels come to assume in certain cases the aspect of union-vowels, or insertions between root or stem and ending of inflection or of derivation.\n\na. That character belongs oftenest to i, which is very widely used: 1. before the s of aorist and future and desiderative stems, as in \u00e1j\u012bvi\u1e63am, j\u012bvi\u1e63y\u0101\u0301mi, j\u00edj\u012bvi\u1e63\u0101mi; 2. in tense-inflection, especially perfect, as jij\u012bvim\u00e1; occasionally also present, as \u00e1niti, r\u00f3diti; 3. in derivation, as j\u012bvit\u00e1, kh\u00e1nitum, janit\u1e5b\u0301, roci\u1e63\u1e47\u00fa, etc. etc.\n\nb. Long \u012b is used sometimes instead of short: thus, \u00e1grah\u012b\u1e63am, grah\u012b\u1e63y\u0101\u0301mi; brav\u012bti, v\u0101vad\u012bti; tar\u012bt\u1e5b\u0301, sav\u012bt\u1e5b\u0301; it is also often introduced before s and t of the 2d and 3d sing. of verbs: thus, \u0101\u0301s\u012bs, \u0101\u0301s\u012bt.\n\nc. For details respecting these, and the more irregular and sporadic occurrences of u- and a-vowels in the same character, see below.\n\n<center>Nasal Increment.</center>\n\n255. Both in roots and in endings, a distinction of stronger and weaker forms is very often made by the presence or absence of a nasal element, a nasal mute or anusv\u0101ra, before a following consonant. In general, the stronger form is doubtless the more original; but, in the present condition of the language, the nasal has come in great measure to seem, and to some extent also to be used, as an actually strengthening element, introduced under certain conditions in formative and inflective processes.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235479":{"pageid":235479,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/115","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Cs\u00f6rf\u00f6ly D\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>a.

As, by reason of the strengthening and weakening changes indicated above, the same root or stem not seldom exhibits, in the processes of inflection and derivation, varieties of stronger and weaker form, the distinction and description of these varieties forms an important part of the subjects hereafter to be treated.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"236696":{"pageid":236696,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/116","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Cs\u00f6rf\u00f6ly D\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><center><big>CHAPTER IV.</big>\n\n\nDECLENSION.</center>\n\n261. The general subject of declension includes nouns, adjectives, and pronouns, all of which are inflected in essentially the same manner. But while the correspondence of nouns and adjectives is so close that they cannot well be separated in treatment (chap. V.), the pronouns, which exhibit many peculiarities, will be best dealt with in a separate chapter (VII.); and the words designating number, or numerals, also form a class peculiar enough to require to be presented by themselves (chap. VI.).\n\n262. Declensional forms show primarily case and number; but they also indicate gender \u2014 since, though the distinctions of gender are made partly in the stem itself, they also appear, to no inconsiderable extent, in the changes of inflection.\n\n263. Gender. The genders are three, namely masculine, feminine, and neuter, as in the other older Indo-European languages; and they follow in general the same laws of distribution as, for example, in Greek and Latin.\n\na. The only words which show no sign of gender-distinction are the personal pronouns of the first and second person (491), and the numerals above ''four'' (483).\n\n264. Number. The numbers are three \u2014 singular, dual, and plural.\n\na. A few words are used only in the plural: as <tt>d\u0101r\u0101s</tt> ''wife'', <tt>\u0101\u0301pas</tt> ''water''; the numeral <tt>dva</tt> ''two'', is dual only; and, as in other languages, many words are, by the nature of their use, found to occur only in the singular.\n\n265. As to the uses of the numerals, it needs only to be remarked that the dual is (with only very rare and sporadic exceptions) used strictly in all cases where two objects are logically indicated, whether directly or by combination of two individuals: thus, <tt>\u00e7iv\u00e9 te dy\u0101\u0301v\u0101p\u1e5bthiv\u012b\u0301 ubh\u00e9 st\u0101m</tt> ''may heaven and earth both be propitious to thee!'' <tt>d\u0101iva\u1e41 ca m\u0101nu\u1e63a\u1e41 ca hot\u0101r\u0101u v\u1e5btv\u0101</tt> ''having chosen both the divine and the human sacrificers''; <tt>pathor devay\u0101nasya pit\u1e5by\u0101\u1e47asya ca</tt> ''of the two paths leading respectively to the gods and to the Fathers''.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"236707":{"pageid":236707,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/117","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Cs\u00f6rf\u00f6ly D\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>a. The dual is used alone (without <tt>dva</tt> ''two'') properly when the duality of the objects indicated is well understood; thus, <tt>a\u00e7v\u00edn\u0101u</tt> ''the two A\u00e7vins''; <tt>\u00edndrasya h\u00e1r\u012b</tt> ''Indra's two bays''; but <tt>tasya dv\u0101v a\u00e7v\u0101u sta\u1e25</tt> ''he has two horses''. But now and then the dual stands alone pregnantly: thus, <tt>veda\u1e41 ved\u0101u ved\u0101n v\u0101</tt> ''one Veda or two or more than two''; <tt>eka\u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6de \u00e7ate</tt> ''two hundred and sixty-one''.</p>\n\n266. Case. The cases are (including the vocative) eight: nominative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, locative, and vocative.\n\na. The order in which they are here mentioned is that established for them by the Hindu grammarians, and accepted from these by Western scholars. The Hindu names of the cases are founded on this order: the nominative is called <tt>pratham\u0101</tt> ''first'', the accusative <tt>dvit\u012by\u0101</tt> ''second'', the genitive <tt>\u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b</tt> ''sixth'' (sc. <tt>vibhakti</tt> ''division'', i.e. ''case''), etc. The object sought in the arrangement is simply to set next to one another those cases which are to a greater or less extent, in one or another number, identical in form; and, putting the nominative first, as leading case, there is no other order by which that object could be attained. The vocative is not considered and named by the native grammarians as a case like the rest; in this work, it will be given in the singular (where alone it is ever distinguished from the nominative otherwise than by accent) at the end of the series of cases.\n\nA compendious statement of the uses of the cases is given in the following paragraphs:\n\n267. Uses of the Nominative. The nominative is the case of the subject of the sentence, and of any word qualifying the subject, whether attributively, in apposition, or as predicate.\n\n268. One or two peculiar constructions call for notice:\n\na. A predicate nominative, instead of an objective predicate in the accusative, is used with middle verb-forms that signify regarding or calling one\u2019s self: thus, <tt>s\u00f3mam manyate papiv\u0101\u0301n</tt> (RV.) ''he thinks he has been drinking soma''; <tt>s\u00e1 manyeta pur\u0101\u1e47av\u00edt</tt> (AV.) ''he may regard himself as wise in ancient things''; <tt>durg\u0101\u0301d v\u0101\u0301 \u0101hart\u0101\u0301 \u2019vocath\u0101\u1e25</tt> (MS.) ''thou hast claimed to be a savior out of trouble''; <tt>\u00edndro br\u0101hma\u1e47\u00f3 br\u00fav\u0101\u1e47a\u1e25</tt> (TS.) ''Indra pretending to be a Brahman''; <tt>katthase satyav\u0101d\u012b</tt> (R.) ''thou boasted thyself truthful''. Similarly with the phrase <tt>r\u016bpa\u1e41 k\u1e5b</tt>: thus, <tt>k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u00f3 r\u016bp\u00e1\u1e41 k\u1e5btv\u0101\u0301</tt> (TS.) ''taking on a black form'' (i.e. ''making shape for himself as one that is black'').\n\nb. A word made by <tt>iti</tt> (1102) logically predicate to an object is ordinarily nominative: thus, <tt>svarg\u00f3 lok\u00e1 \u00edti y\u00e1\u1e41 v\u00e1danti</tt> (AV.) ''what they call the heavenly world'': <tt>tam agni\u1e63\u1e6doma ity \u0101cak\u1e63ate</tt> (AB.) ''it they style'' <tt>agni\u1e63\u1e6doma; vidarbhar\u0101jatanay\u0101\u1e41 damayant\u012b \u2019ti viddhi m\u0101m</tt> (MBh.) ''know me for the Vidarbha-king\u2019s daughter, Damayant\u012b by''<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"236715":{"pageid":236715,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/118","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Cs\u00f6rf\u00f6ly D\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>''name''. Both constructions are combined in <tt>aj\u00f1a\u1e41 hi b\u0101lam ity \u0101hu\u1e25 pite \u2019ty eva tu mantradam</tt> (M.) ''for to an ignorant man they give the name of \u2018child\u2019, but that of \u2018father\u2019 to one who imparts the sacred texts.''\n\nc. A nominative, instead of a second vocative, is sometimes added to a vocative by <tt>ca</tt> ''and'': thus, <tt>\u00edndra\u00e7 ca s\u00f3mam pibatam b\u1e5bhaspate</tt> (RV.) ''together with Indra, do ye two drink the soma, O B\u1e5bhaspati!'' <tt>v\u00ed\u00e7ve dev\u0101 y\u00e1jam\u0101na\u00e7 ca s\u012bdat\u0101</tt> (TS.) ''O ye All-Gods, and the sacrificer, take seats!''\n\n269. Uses of the Accusative. The accusative is especially the case of the direct object of a transitive verb, and of any word qualifying that object, as attribute or appositive or objective predicate. The construction of the verb is shared, of course, by its participles and infinitives; but also, in Sanskrit, by a number of other derivatives, having a more or less participial or infinitival character, and even sometimes by nouns and adjectives. A few prepositions are accompanied by the accusative. As less direct object, or goal of motion or action, the accusative is construed especially with verbs of approach and address. It is found used more adverbially as adjunct of place or time or manner; and a host of adverbs are accusative cases in form. Two accusatives are often found as objects of the same verb.\n\n270. The use of the accusative as direct object of a transitive verb and of its infinitives and participles hardly needs illustration; an example or two are: <tt>agn\u00edm \u012b\u1e0de</tt> ''I praise Agni''; <tt>n\u00e1mo bh\u00e1ranta\u1e25</tt> ''bringing homage''; <tt>bh\u016b\u0301yo d\u0101\u0301tum arhasi</tt> ''thou shouldst give more''. Of predicate words qualifying the object, an example is <tt>t\u00e1m ugr\u00e1\u1e41 k\u1e5b\u1e47omi t\u00e1\u1e41 br\u00e1hm\u0101\u1e47am</tt> (RV.) ''him I make formidable, him a priest''.\n\n271. Of verbal derivatives having so far a participial character that they share the construction of the verb, the variety is considerable: thus \u2014\n\na. Derivatives in <tt>u</tt> from desiderative stems (1038) have wholly the character of present participles: thus, <tt>damayant\u012bm abh\u012bpsava\u1e25</tt> (MBh.) ''desiring to win Damayant\u012b''; <tt>did\u1e5bk\u1e63ur janak\u0101tmaj\u0101m</tt> (R.) ''desiring to see Janaka\u2019s daughter''. Rarely, also, the verbal noun in <tt>\u0101</tt> from such a root: thus, <tt>svargam abhik\u0101n\u0304k\u1e63ay\u0101</tt> (R.) ''with desire of paradise''.\n\nb. So-called primary derivatives in <tt>in</tt> have the same character: thus, <tt>m\u0101\u0301\u1e41 k\u0101m\u00edn\u012b</tt> (AV.) ''loving me''; <tt>enam abhibh\u0101\u1e63i\u1e47\u012b</tt> (MBh.) ''addressing him''. Even the obviously secondary <tt>garbh\u00edn</tt> has in \u00c7B. the same construction: thus, <tt>s\u00e1rv\u0101\u1e47i bh\u016bt\u0101\u0301ni garbhy \u00e0bhavat</tt> ''he became pregnant with all beings''.\n\nc. Derivations in <tt>aka</tt>, in the later language: as, <tt>bhavantam abhiv\u0101daka\u1e25</tt> (MBh.) ''intending to salute you''; <tt>mithil\u0101m avarodhaka\u1e25</tt> (R.) ''besieging Mithil\u0101''.\n\nd. Nouns in <tt>tar</tt>, very frequently in the older language, and as periphrastic future forms (942 ff.) in the later: thus, <tt>h\u00e1nt\u0101 y\u00f3 v\u1e5btr\u00e1\u1e41</tt><noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"236721":{"pageid":236721,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/119","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Cs\u00f6rf\u00f6ly D\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><tt>s\u00e1nito \u2019t\u00e1 v\u0101\u0301ja\u1e41 d\u0101\u0301t\u0101 magh\u0101\u0301ni</tt> (RV.)

Derivatives in <tt>uka</tt>, very frequently in the <tt>Br\u0101hma\u1e47a</tt> language: thus, <tt>vats\u0101\u0301\u1e45\u00e7 ca gh\u0101\u0301tuko v\u1e5b\u0301ka\u1e25</tt> (AV.)

''the women fall in love with him''.\n\nh. Other cases are more sporadic: thus, derivatives in <tt>a</tt>, as <tt>\u00edndro d\u1e5b\u1e0dh\u0101\u0301 cid \u0101ruj\u00e1\u1e25</tt> (RV.)

Examples of an accusative with an ordinary noun or adjective are only occasional: such words as <tt>\u00e1nuvrata</tt> ''faithful to'', <tt>pr\u00e1tir\u016bpa</tt> ''corresponding to'', <tt>abhidh\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47u</tt> ''daring to cope with'', <tt>praty\u00e1\u00f1c</tt> ''opposite to'', may be regarded as taking an accusative in virtue of the preposition they contain; also <tt>\u00e1nuka</tt>, as <tt>\u00e1nuk\u0101 dev\u0101\u0301 v\u00e1ru\u1e47am</tt> (MS.)

The direct construction of cases with prepositions is comparatively restricted in Sanskrit (1123 ff.). With the accusative are oftenest found <tt>prati</tt>, ''opposite to, in reference to'', etc.; also <tt>anu</tt> ''after, in the course of''; <tt>antar</tt> or <tt>antar\u0101</tt> ''between''; rarely <tt>ati</tt> ''across''; <tt>abhi</tt> ''against, to''; and others (1129). Case-forms which have assumed a prepositional value are also often used with the accusative: as <tt>antare\u1e47a, uttare\u1e47a, dak\u1e63i\u1e47ena, avare\u1e47a, \u016brdhvam, \u1e5bte</tt>.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"236729":{"pageid":236729,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/120","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Cs\u00f6rf\u00f6ly D\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>274. The accusative is very often found also as object of verbs which in the related languages are not transitive.\n\na. It stands especially as the goal of motion, with verbs of going, bringing, sending, and the like: thus, <tt>vidarbh\u0101n agaman</tt> (MBh.) ''they went to Vidarbha''; <tt>diva\u1e41 yayu\u1e25</tt> (MBh.) ''they went to heaven''; <tt>vanagulm\u0101n dh\u0101vanta\u1e25</tt> (MBh.) ''running to woods and bushes''; <tt>ap\u00f3 d\u00edvam \u00fad vahanti</tt> (AV.) ''they carry up waters to the sky''; <tt>dev\u0101\u0301n yaje</tt> (AV.) ''I make offering to the gods''.\n\nb. With verbs meaning ''go'', this is an extremely common construction; and the use of such a verb with an abstract noun makes peculiar phrases of ''becoming'': thus, <tt>samat\u0101m eti</tt> ''he goes to equality'' (i.e. ''becomes equal''); <tt>sa gacched badhyat\u0101m mama</tt> (MBh.) ''he shall become liable to be slain by me''; <tt>sa pa\u00f1catvam \u0101gata\u1e25</tt> (H.) ''he was resolved into the five elements'' (''underwent dissolution, died'').\n\nc. Verbs of speaking follow the same rule: thus, <tt>tam abrav\u012bt</tt> ''he said to him''; <tt>pr\u0101kro\u00e7ad ucc\u0101ir n\u0101i\u1e63adham</tt> (MBh.) ''she cried out loudly to the Nishadhan''; <tt>y\u00e1s tvo \u2019v\u0101\u0301ca</tt> (AV.) ''who spoke to thee''.\n\nd. The assumption of an accusative object is exceptionally easy in Sanskrit, and such an object is often taken by a verb or phrase in which is strictly of intransitive character: thus, <tt>s\u00e1has\u0101 pr\u0101\u0301 \u2019sy any\u0101\u0301n</tt> (RV.) ''in might thou excellest'' (lit. ''art ahead'') ''others'', dev\u0101\u0301 v\u0101\u00ed br\u00e1hma s\u00e1m avadanta (MS.) ''the gods were discussing'' (lit. ''were talking together'') <tt>brahman; ant\u00e1r v\u0101\u00ed m\u0101 yajn\u0304\u0101\u0301d yanti</tt> (MS.) ''surely they are cutting me off'' (lit. ''are going between'') ''from the offering''; <tt>t\u0101\u0301\u1e41 s\u00e1m babh\u016bva</tt> (\u00c7B.) ''he had intercourse with her''.\n\n275. Examples of the cognate accusative, or accusative of implied object, are not infrequent: thus, <tt>t\u00e1pas tapy\u0101mahe</tt> (AV.) ''we do penance''; <tt>t\u00e9 h\u0101i \u2019t\u0101\u0301m edhat\u00fam edh\u0101\u0301\u1e41 cakrire</tt> (\u00c7B.) ''they prospered with that prosperity''; <tt>u\u1e63itv\u0101 sukhav\u0101sam</tt> (R.) ''abiding happily''.\n\n276. The accusative is often used in more adverbial constructions. Thus:\n\na.

''six leagues high''.\n\nb. Much more often, to denote measure or duration of time: thus, <tt>s\u00e1 sa\u1e41vatsar\u00e1m \u016brdhv\u00f2 \u2018ti\u1e63\u1e6dhat</tt> (AV.)

Special cases are occasionally met with: thus, <tt>brahmac\u00e1ryam uv\u0101sa</tt> (\u00c7B.) ''he kept a term of studentship''; <tt>phal\u00e1m pacy\u00e1nte</tt> (MS.) ''they ripen their fruit''; <tt>g\u0101\u0301\u1e41 d\u012bvyadhvam</tt> (MS., S.) ''gamble for a cow''.\n\n277. The accusative is, of course, freely used with other cases to limit the same verb, as the sense requires. And whenever it is usable with a verb in two different constructions, the verb may take two accusatives, one in each construction: and such combinations are quite frequent in Sanskrit. Thus, with verbs of appealing, asking, having recourse: as, <tt>ap\u00f3 y\u0101c\u0101mi bhe\u1e63aj\u00e1m</tt> (RV.) ''I ask the waters for medicine''; <tt>tv\u0101m aha\u1e41 satyam icch\u0101mi</tt> (R.) ''I desire truth from thee''; <tt>tv\u0101\u1e41 vaya\u1e41 \u00e7ara\u1e47a\u1e41 gat\u0101\u1e25</tt> (MBh.) ''we have resorted to thee for succor'';\u2014with verbs of bringing, sending, following, imparting, saying: as, <tt>gurutva\u1e41 nara\u1e41 nayanti</tt> (H.) ''they bring a man to respectability''; <tt>s\u012bt\u0101 c\u0101 \u2019nvetu m\u0101\u1e41 vanam</tt> (R.)

''they let me go home well adorned''; <tt>t\u0101m idam abrav\u012bt</tt> (MBh.) ''this he said to her'';\u2014and in other less common cases: as, <tt>v\u1e5bk\u1e63\u00e1\u1e41 pakv\u00e1\u1e41 ph\u00e1la\u1e41 dh\u016bnuhi</tt> (RV.)

A causative form of a transitive verb regularly admits two accusative objects: thus, <tt>dev\u0101\u0301\u1e45 u\u00e7at\u00e1\u1e25 p\u0101yay\u0101 hav\u00ed\u1e25</tt> (RV.)

''he makes the plants bear fruit''; <tt>va\u1e47ijo d\u0101payet kar\u0101n</tt> (M.) ''he should cause the merchants to pay taxes''. But such a causative sometimes takes an instrumental instead of a second accusative: see 282 b.\n\n278. Uses of the Instrumental. The instrumental is originally the ''with''-case: it denotes adjacency, accompaniment, association\u2014passing over into the expression of means and instrument by the same transfer of meaning which appears in the English prepositions ''with'' and ''by''.\n\na. Nearly all the uses of the case are readily deducible from this fundamental meaning, and show nothing anomalous or difficult.\n\n279. The instrumental is often used to signify accompaniment: thus, <tt>agn\u00edr dev\u00e9bhir \u0101\u0301 gamet</tt> (RV.) ''may Agni come hither along with the gods''; <tt>mar\u00fadbh\u012b rudr\u00e1\u1e41 huvema</tt> (RV.) ''we would call Rudra with the Marurts''; <tt>dv\u0101pare\u1e47a sah\u0101yena kva y\u0101syasi</tt> (MBh.) ''whither wilt thou go, with Dv\u0101para for companion?'' <tt>kathayan n\u0101i\u1e63adhena</tt> (MBh.) ''talking with the Nishadhan''.

Of special applications, the following may be noticed:\n\na. Accordance, equality, likeness, and the like: thus, <tt>sam\u00e1\u1e41 jy\u00f3ti\u1e25 s\u016b\u0301rye\u1e47a</tt> (AV.) ''a brightness equal with the sun''; <tt>ye\u1e63\u0101m aha\u1e41 na p\u0101darajas\u0101 tulya\u1e25</tt> (MBh.) ''to the dust of whose feet I am not equal''.\n\nb. Price (by which obtained): thus, <tt>da\u00e7\u00e1bhi\u1e25 kr\u012b\u1e47\u0101ti dhen\u00fabhi\u1e25</tt> (RV.)

''the king will give thee the secret science of dice in return for that of horses''.\n\nc. Medium, and hence also space or distance or road, traversed: thus, <tt>udn\u0101\u0301 n\u00e1 n\u0101\u0301vam anayanta</tt> (RV.) ''they brought [him] as it were a ship by water''; <tt>\u00e9 \u2019h\u00e1 y\u0101tam path\u00edbhir devay\u0101\u0301n\u0101i\u1e25</tt> (RV.) ''come hither by god-traveled paths''; <tt>jagmur vih\u0101yas\u0101</tt> (MBh.) ''they went off through the air''.\n\nd.

This use of the instrumental borders upon that of the locative and ablative.\n\ne. The part of the body on (or by) which anything is borne is usually expressed by the instrumental: as, <tt>kukkura\u1e25 skandheno \u2019hyate</tt> (H.) ''a dog is carried on the shoulder''; and this construction is extended to such cases as <tt>tulay\u0101 k\u1e5btam</tt> (H.) ''put on'' (i.e. ''so as to be carried by'') ''a balance''.\n\nf. Not infrequently used are such phrases as <tt>bahun\u0101 kim pral\u0101pena</tt> (R.) '''what is the use of'' (i.e. ''is gained by'') ''much talking''? <tt>ko nu me j\u012bviten\u0101 \u2019rtha\u1e25</tt> (MBh.)

An instrumental of accompaniment is occasionally used almost or quite with the value of an instrumental absolute: thus, <tt>na tvay\u0101 \u2019tra may\u0101 \u2019vasthitena k\u0101 \u2019pi cint\u0101 k\u0101ry\u0101</tt> (Pa\u00f1c.)

The construction of a passive verb (or participle) with an instrumental of the agent is common from the earliest period, and becomes decidedly more so later, the passive participle with instrumental taking to no small extent the place of an active verb with its subject. Thus, <tt>yam\u00e9na datt\u00e1\u1e25</tt> (RV.) ''given by Yama''; <tt>\u1e5b\u0301\u1e63ibhir \u012b\u0301\u1e0dya\u1e25</tt> (RV.) ''to be praised by sages''; <tt>vy\u0101dhena j\u0101la\u1e41 vist\u012br\u1e47am</tt> (H.) ''by the hunter a net [was] spread''; <tt>tac chrutv\u0101 jaradgaveno \u2019ktam</tt> (H.) ''Jaradgava, hearing this, said''; <tt>may\u0101 gantavyam</tt> (H.) ''I shall go''. A predicate to the instrumental subject of such a construction is, of course, also in the instrumental: thus, <tt>adhun\u0101 tav\u0101 \u2019nucare\u1e47a may\u0101 sarvath\u0101 bhavitavyam</tt> (H.) ''henceforth I shall always by thy companion''; <tt>avahit\u0101ir bhavitavyam bhavadbhi\u1e25</tt> (Vikr.) ''you must be attentive''.</p>\n\nb. A causative verb sometimes takes an instrumental instead of an accusative as second object: thus, <tt>t\u0101\u1e41 \u00e7vabhi\u1e25 kh\u0101dayed r\u0101j\u0101</tt> (M.) ''the king should have her devoured by dogs''; <tt>t\u0101\u0301 v\u00e1ru\u1e47en\u0101 \u2019gr\u0101hayat</tt> (MS.) ''he caused Varu\u1e47a to seize them''.\n\n283. Many instrumental constructions are such as call in translation for other prepositions than ''with'' or ''by''; yet the true instrumental relation is usually to be traced, especially if the etymological sense of the words be carefully considered.\n\na. More anomalously, however, the instrumental is used interchangeably with the ablative with words signifying separation: thus, <tt>vats\u0101\u00edr v\u00edyut\u0101\u1e25</tt> (RV.) ''separated from their calves''; <tt>m\u0101\u0301 \u2019h\u00e1m \u0101tm\u00e1n\u0101 v\u00ed r\u0101dhi\u1e63i (AV.) ''let me not be severed from the breath of life''; <tt>sa tay\u0101 vyayujyata</tt> (MBh.) ''he was parted from her''; <tt>p\u0101pm\u00e1n\u0101i \u2019v\u0101\u00ed \u2019na\u1e41 v\u00ed punanti</tt> (MS.) ''they cleanse him from evil'' (compare English ''parted with''). The same meaning may be given to the case even when accompanied by <tt>saha</tt> ''with'': thus, <tt>bhartr\u0101 saha viyoga\u1e25</tt> (MBh.) ''separation from her husband''.\n\n284. The prepositions taking the instrumental (1127) are those signifying ''with'' and the like: thus, <tt>saha</tt>, with the adverbial words containing <tt>sa</tt> as an element, as <tt>s\u0101kam</tt>, <tt>s\u0101rdham</tt>, <tt>saratham</tt>;\u2014and, in general, a word compounded with <tt>sa</tt>, <tt>sam</tt>, <tt>saha</tt> takes an instrumental as its regular and natural complement. But also the preposition <tt>vin\u0101</tt> ''without'' takes sometimes the instrumental (cf. 283 a).\n\n285. Uses of the Dative. The dative is the case of the indirect object\u2014or that toward or in the direction of or in order to or for which anything is or is done (either intransitively or to a direct object).\n\na. In more physical connections, the uses of the dative approach those of the accusative (the more proper ''to''-case), and the two are sometimes interchangeable; but the general value of the dative as the ''toward''- or ''for''-case is almost everywhere distinctly to be traced.\n\n286. Thus, the dative is used with\u2014\n\na. Words signifying ''give'', ''share out'', ''assign'', and the like: thus, <tt>y\u00f3 n\u00e1 d\u00e1d\u0101ti s\u00e1khye</tt> (RV.)

In some of these constructions the genitive and locative are also used: see below.\n\n287. In its more distinctive sense, as signifying ''for, for the benefit of, with reference to'', and the like, the dative is used freely, and in a great variety of constructions. And this use passes over into that of the dative of end or purpose, which is extremely common. Thus, <tt>\u00ed\u1e63u\u1e41 k\u1e5b\u1e47v\u0101n\u0101\u0301 \u00e1san\u0101ya</tt> (AV.)

''be it bound on in order to royalty for me, in order to destruction for my enemies''.\n\na. Such a dative is much used predicatively (and oftenest with the copula omitted), in the sense of ''makes for, tends toward''; also ''is intended for'', and so ''must''; or ''is liable to'', and so ''can''. Thus, <tt>upade\u00e7o m\u016brkh\u0101\u1e47\u0101m prakop\u0101ya na \u00e7\u0101ntaye</tt> (H.)

These uses of the dative are in the older language especially illustrated by the dative infinitives, for which see 982.\n\n288. The dative is not to be used with prepositions (1124).\n\n289. Uses of the Ablative. The ablative is the ''from''-case, in the various senses of that preposition; it is used to express removal, separation, distinction, issue, and the like.\n\n290. The ablative is used where expulsion, removal, distinction, release, defense, and other kindred relations are expressed: thus, <tt>t\u00e9 sedhanti path\u00f3 v\u1e5b\u0301kam</tt> (AV.)

The ablative is used where procedure or issue from something as from a source or starting-point is signified: thus, <tt>\u00e7ukr\u0101\u0301 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101\u0301d ajani\u1e63\u1e6da</tt> (RV.) ''the bright one has been born from the black one''; <tt>lobh\u0101t krodha\u1e25 prabhavati</tt> (MBh.) ''passion arises from greed''; <tt>v\u0101\u0301t\u0101t te pr\u0101\u1e47\u00e1m avidam</tt> (AV.) ''I have won thy life-breath from the wind''; <tt>y\u00e9 pr\u0101\u0301cy\u0101 di\u00e7\u00f3 abhid\u0101\u0301santy asm\u0101\u0301n</tt> (AV.) ''who attack us from the eastern quarter''; <tt>tac chrutv\u0101 sakhiga\u1e47\u0101t</tt> (MBh.) ''having heard that from the troop of friends''; <tt>v\u0101yur antarik\u1e63\u0101d abh\u0101\u1e63ata</tt> (MBh.) ''the wind spoke from the sky''.\n\na. Hence also, procedure as from a cause or occasion is signified by the ablative: this is especially frequent in the later language, and in technical phraseology is a standing construction; it borders on instrumental constructions. Thus, <tt>v\u00e1jrasya \u00e7\u00fa\u1e63\u1e47\u0101d dad\u0101ra</tt> (RV.) ''from'' (''by reason of'') ''the fury of the thunderbolt he burst asunder''; <tt>yasya da\u1e47\u1e0dabhay\u0101t sarve dharmam anurudhyanti</tt> (MBh.) ''from fear of whose rod all are constant to duty''; <tt>ak\u0101rami\u00e7ritatv\u0101d ek\u0101rasya</tt> (Tribh.) ''because'' e ''contains an element of'' a.\n\nb. Very rarely, an ablative has the sense of ''after'': thus, <tt>agacchann ahor\u0101tr\u0101t t\u012brtham</tt> (MBh.) ''they went to the shrine after a whole day''; <tt>\u1e6dak\u0101r\u0101t sak\u0101re tak\u0101re\u1e47a</tt> (APr.) ''after'' \u1e6d, ''before'' s, ''is inserted'' t\n\n292. One or two special applications of the ablative construction are to be noticed:\n\na. The ablative with words implying fear (terrified recoil from): thus, <tt>t\u00e1sy\u0101 j\u0101t\u0101\u0301y\u0101\u1e25 s\u00e1rvam abibhet</tt> (AV.) ''everything was afraid of her at her birth''; <tt>y\u00e1sm\u0101d r\u00e9janta k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u00e1ya\u1e25</tt> (RV.) ''at whom mortals tremble''; <tt>yu\u1e63m\u00e1d bhiy\u0101\u0301</tt> (RV.) ''through fear of you''; <tt>yasm\u0101n no \u2019dvijate loka\u1e25</tt> (BhG.) ''of whom the world is not afraid''.\n\nb. The ablative of comparison (distinction from): thus, <tt>pr\u00e1 ririce div\u00e1 \u00edndra\u1e25 p\u1e5bthivy\u0101\u0301\u1e25</tt> (RV.) ''Indra is greater than the heaven and the earth''. With a comparative, or other word used in a kindred way, the ablative is the regular and almost constant construction: thus, <tt>sv\u0101d\u00f3\u1e25 sv\u0101\u0301d\u012bya\u1e25</tt> (RV.) ''sweeter than the sweet''; <tt>ki\u1e41 tasm\u0101d du\u1e25khataram</tt> (MBh.) ''what is more painful than that?'' <tt>ko mitr\u0101d anya\u1e25</tt> (H.) ''who else than a friend''; <tt>g\u0101 av\u1e5b\u1e47\u012bth\u0101 mat</tt> (AB.) ''thou hast chosen the kine rather than me''; <tt>aj\u00f1ebhyo granthina\u1e25 \u00e7re\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 granthibhyo dh\u0101ri\u1e47o var\u0101\u1e25</tt> (M.) ''possessors of texts are better than ignorant men; rememberers are better than possessors''; <tt>t\u00e1d any\u00e1tra tv\u00e1n n\u00ed dadhmasi</tt> (AV.) ''we set this down elsewhere'' (''away'') ''from thee''; <tt>p\u016b\u0301rv\u0101 v\u00ed\u00e7vasm\u0101d bh\u00favan\u0101t</tt> (RV.) ''earlier than all beings''.\n\nc. Occasionally, a probably possessive genitive is used with the comparative; or an instrumental (as in comparison of equality): thus,<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"237156":{"pageid":237156,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/126","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><tt>n\u0101 \u2019sti dhanyataro mama</tt> (R.)

Occasionally, an ablative is used instead of a partitive genitive: thus, <tt>mithun\u0101d eka\u1e41 jagh\u0101na</tt> (R.) ''he slew one out of the pair''; <tt>tebhya ekam</tt> (KSS.) ''one of them''.\n\n293. The ablative is used with a variety of prepositions and words sharing a prepositional character (1128); but all these have rather an adverbial value, as strengthening or defining the ''from''-relation, than any proper governing force. We may notice here:\n\na. In the Veda, <tt>\u00e1dhi</tt> and <tt>p\u00e1ri</tt> are much used as directing and strengthening adjuncts with the ablative: as, <tt>j\u0101t\u00f3 him\u00e1vatas p\u00e1ri</tt> (AV.) ''born from the Himalaya'' (''forth''); <tt>samudr\u0101\u0301d \u00e1dhi jaj\u00f1i\u1e63e</tt> (AV.) ''thou art born from the ocean''; <tt>c\u00e1rantam p\u00e1ri tasth\u00fa\u1e63a\u1e25</tt> (RV.) ''moving forth from that which stands fast''.\n\nb. Also <tt>pur\u0101\u0301</tt> (and <tt>pur\u00e1s</tt>), in the sense of ''forward from'', and hence ''before'': as, <tt>pur\u0101\u0301 j\u00e1rasa\u1e25</tt> (RV.) ''before old age'': and hence also, with words of protection and the like, ''from'': as <tt>\u00e7a\u00e7am\u0101n\u00e1\u1e25 pur\u0101\u0301 nid\u00e1\u1e25</tt> (RV.) ''securing from ill-will''.\n\nc. Also \u0101\u0301, in the sense of ''hither from, all the way from'': as, <tt>\u0101\u0301 m\u016b\u0301l\u0101d \u00e1nu \u00e7u\u1e63yatu</tt> (AV.)

But usually, and especially in the later language, the measurement of interval implied in <tt>\u0101\u0301</tt> is reversed in direction, and the construction means ''all the way to, until'': as, <tt>yat\u012b\u0301 gir\u00edbhya \u0101\u0301 samudr\u0101\u0301t</tt> (RV.) ''going from the mountains to the ocean''; <tt>\u0101\u0301 \u2019sy\u00e1 yaj\u00f1\u00e1syo \u2019d\u1e5b\u0301ca\u1e25</tt> (VS.) ''until the end of this sacrifice''; <tt>\u0101 \u1e63o\u1e0da\u00e7\u0101t</tt> (M.) ''till the sixteenth year''; <tt>\u0101 prad\u0101n\u0101t</tt> (\u00c7.) ''until her marriage''.\n\n294. Uses of the Genitive. a. The proper value of the genitive is adjectival; it belongs to and qualifies a noun, designating something relating to the latter in a manner which the nature of the case, or the connection, defines more nearly. Other genitive constructions, with adjective or verb or preposition, appear to arise out of this, by a more or less distinctly traceable connection.\n\nb. The use of the genitive has become much extended, especially in the later language, by attribution of a noun-character to the adjective, and by pregnant verbal construction, so that it often bears the aspect of being a substitute for other cases\u2014as dative, instrumental, ablative, locative.\n\n295. The genitive in its normal adjective construction with a noun or pronoun is classifiable into the usual varieties: as, genitive of possession or appurtenance, including the complement of implied relation\u2014this is, as elsewhere, the commonest of all; the so-called partitive genitive; the subjective and objective genitives; and so on. Genitives of apposition or<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"237163":{"pageid":237163,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/127","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>equivalence (''city of Rome''), and of characteristic (''man of honor''), do not occur, and hardly that of material (''house of wood''). Examples are: <tt>\u00edndrasya v\u00e1jra\u1e25</tt> ''Indra's thunderbolt''; <tt>pit\u0101 putr\u0101\u1e47\u0101m</tt> ''father of sons''; <tt>putra\u1e25 pitu\u1e25</tt> ''son of the father''; <tt>pitu\u1e25 k\u0101ma\u1e25 putrasya</tt> ''the father's love of the son''; <tt>ke na\u1e25</tt> ''which of us''; <tt>\u00e7ata\u1e41 d\u0101s\u012bn\u0101m</tt> ''a hundred female slaves''.\n\na. The expression of possession etc. on the part of pronouns is made almost entirely by the genitive case, and not by a derived possessive adjective (516).\n\nb. Exceptional cases like <tt>nagarasya m\u0101rga\u1e25</tt> ''the road to the city'' (cf. ''le chemin de Paris''), <tt>yasy\u0101 \u2019ha\u1e41 d\u016bta \u012bpsita\u1e25</tt> (MBh.) ''as messenger to whom I am wanted'', are occasionally met with.\n\n296. The genitive is dependent on an adjective:\n\na. A so-called partitive genitive with a superlative, or another word of similar substantival value: thus, <tt>\u00e7re\u1e63\u1e6dha\u1e41 v\u012br\u0101\u1e47\u0101m</tt> ''best of heroes''; <tt>v\u012br\u00fadh\u0101\u1e41 v\u012bry\u00e0vat\u012b</tt> (AV.) ''of plants the mighty'' (''mightiest'') ''one''.\n\nb. Very often, by a transfer of the possessive genitive from noun to adjective, the adjective being treated as if it had noun-value: thus, <tt>tasya sama\u1e25</tt> or <tt>anur\u016bpa\u1e25</tt> or <tt>sad\u1e5b\u00e7a\u1e25</tt> ''resembling him'' (i.e. ''his like''); <tt>tasya priy\u0101</tt> ''dear to him'' (''his dear one''); <tt>tasy\u0101 \u2019viditam</tt> ''unknown to him'' (''his unknown thing''); <tt>h\u00e1vya\u00e7 car\u1e63a\u1e47\u012bn\u0101\u0301m</tt> (RV.) ''to be sacrificed to by mortals'' (''their object of sacrifice''); <tt>\u012bpsito naran\u0101r\u012b\u1e47\u0101m</tt> (MBh.) ''desired of men and women'' (''their object of desire''); <tt>yasya kasya pras\u016bta\u1e25</tt> (H.) ''of whomsoever born'' (''his son''); <tt>hantavyo \u2018smi na te</tt> (MBh.) ''I am not to be slain of thee''; <tt>kim arthin\u0101\u1e41 va\u00f1cayitavyam asti</tt> (H.) ''why should there be a deceiving of supplicants?''\n\nc. In part, by a construction similar to that of verbs which take a genitive object: thus, <tt>abhij\u00f1\u0101 r\u0101jadharm\u0101\u1e47\u0101m</tt> (R.) ''understanding the duties of a king''.\n\n297. The genitive as object of a verb is:\n\na. A possessive genitive of the recipient, by pregnant construction, with verbs signifying ''give, impart, communicate'', and the like: thus, <tt>var\u0101n prad\u0101y\u0101 \u2019sya</tt> (MBh.) ''having bestowed gifts upon him'' (''made them his by bestowal''); <tt>r\u0101j\u00f1o niveditam</tt> (H.) ''it was made known to the king'' (''made his by knowledge''); <tt>yad anyasya pratij\u00f1\u0101ya punar anyasya d\u012byate</tt> (M.) ''that after being promised to one she is given to another''. This construction, by which the genitive becomes substitute for a dative or locative, abounds in the later language, and is extended sometimes to problematic and difficult cases.\n\nb. A (in most cases, probably) partitive genitive, as a less complete or less absolute object than an accusative: thus, with verbs meaning ''partake'' (''eat, drink'', etc.), as <tt>p\u00edba sut\u00e1sya</tt> (AV.) ''drink'' (''of'') ''the soma''; <tt>m\u00e1dhva\u1e25 p\u0101yaya</tt> (RV.) ''cause to drink the sweet drought'';\u2014with verbs meaning ''impart'' (of the thing impearted) etc., as dad\u0101ta no am\u1e5b\u0301tasya</tt> (RV.) ''bestow upon us immortality;\u2014with verbs meaning ''enjoy, be satisfied'' or ''filled''<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"237182":{"pageid":237182,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/128","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>''with'': as, <tt>m\u00e1tsy \u00e1ndhasa\u1e25</tt> (RV.)

''they fill with butter'';\u2014with verbs meaning ''perceive, note, care for, regard'' with feeling of various kinds: as, <tt>v\u00e1si\u1e63\u1e6dhasya stuvat\u00e1 \u00edndro a\u00e7rot</tt> (RV.)

''he was angry at him''.\n\nc. A genitive of more doubtful character, with verbs meaning ''rule'' or ''have authority'': as, <tt>tv\u00e1m \u012b\u00e7i\u1e63e v\u00e1s\u016bn\u0101m</tt> (RV.)

A genitive, instead of an ablative, is sometimes found used with a verb of receiving of any kind (hearing included), and with one of fearing: thus, <tt>yo r\u0101j\u00f1a\u1e25 pratig\u1e5bh\u1e47\u0101ti lubdhasya</tt> (M.) ''whoever accepts a gift from a greedy king''; <tt>\u00e7\u1e5b\u1e47u me</tt> (MBh.) ''learn from me''; <tt>bibh\u012bmas tava</tt> (MBh.) ''we are afraid of thee''.\n\n298. A genitive in its usual possessive sense is often found as predicate, and not seldom with the copula omitted: thus, <tt>y\u00e1th\u0101\u0301 \u2019so m\u00e1ma k\u00e9vala\u1e25</tt> (AV.) ''that thou mayest be wholly mine''; <tt>sarv\u0101\u1e25 sampattayas tasya sa\u1e41tu\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 yasya m\u0101nasam<tt? (H.)

The prepositional constructions of the genitive (1130) are for the most part with such prepositions as are really noun-cases and have the government of such: thus, <tt>agre</tt>, <tt>arthe</tt>, <tt>k\u1e5bte</tt>, and the like; also with other prepositional words which, in the general looseness of use of the genitive, have become assimilated to these. A few more real prepositions take the genitive: either usually, like <tt>up\u00e1ri</tt> ''above'', or occasionally, like <tt>adh\u00e1s</tt>, <tt>ant\u00e1r</tt>, <tt>\u00e1ti</tt>.\n\nb. A genitive is occasionally used in the older language with an adverb, either of place or of time: thus, <tt>y\u00e1tra kv\u00e0 ca kuruk\u1e63etr\u00e1sya</tt> (\u00c7B.) ''in whatever part of Kurukshetra''; <tt>y\u00e1tra t\u00fa bh\u016b\u0301mer j\u0101\u0301yeta</tt> (MS.) ''on what spot of earth he may be born''; <tt>id\u0101\u0301n\u012bm \u00e1hna\u1e25</tt> (RV.)

''twice a year''. Such expression as the last occur also later.\n\n300. a. The genitive is very little used adverbially; a few genitives of time occur in the older language: as, <tt>aktos</tt> ''by night'', <tt>vastos</tt> ''by day''; and there are found later such cases as <tt>kasya cit k\u0101lasya</tt> (\u00c7.) ''after a certain time''; <tt>tata\u1e25 k\u0101lasya mahata\u1e25 prayay\u0101u</tt> (R.) ''then after a long time he went forth''.\n\nb. A genitive, originally of possession, passing over into one of general concernment, comes in the later language (the construction is unknown earlier) to be used absolutely, with an agreeing participle, or quite rarely<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"237191":{"pageid":237191,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/129","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>an adjective.

''of a work needing to be done but left undone time quickly drinks up its essence''\u2014come into currency, by increasing independence of the genitive, such other cases as: <tt>diva\u1e41 jag\u0101ma mun\u012bn\u0101m pa\u00e7yat\u0101\u1e41 tad\u0101</tt> (R.)

''as he thus lamented, a divine messenger coming addressed him''; <tt>iti v\u0101dina ev\u0101 \u2019sya dhenur \u0101vav\u1e5bte van\u0101t</tt> (Ragh.) ''while he thus spoke, the cow came from the forest''. The genitive always indicates a living actor, and the participle is usually one of seeing or hearing or uttering, especially the former. The construction is said by the Hindu grammarians to convey an implication of disregard or despite; and such is often to be recognized in it, though not prevailingly.\n\n301. Uses of the Locative. a. The locative is properly the ''in''-case, the case expressing situation or location; but its sphere of use has been somewhat extended, so as to touch and overlap the boundaries of other cases, for which it seems to be a substitute.\n\nb. Unimportant variations of the sense of ''in'' are those of ''amid'' or ''among'', ''on'', and ''at''. Of course, also, situation in time as well as place is indicated by the case; and it is applied to yet less physical relations, to sphere of action and feeling and knowledge, to state of things, to accompanying circumstance; and out of this last grows the frequent use of the locative as the case absolute.\n\nc. Moreover, by a pregnant construction, the locative is used to denote the place of rest or cessation of action or motion (''into'' or ''on to'' instead of ''in'' or ''on''; German ''in'' with accusative instead of dative: compare English ''there'' for ''thither'').\n\n302. a. The locative of situation in space hardly needs illustration. An example or two are: <tt>y\u00e9 dev\u0101\u0301 div\u00ed sth\u00e1</tt> (AV.) ''which of you gods are in heaven''; <tt>na deve\u1e63u na yak\u1e63e\u1e63u t\u0101d\u1e5bk</tt> (MBh.) ''not among gods or Yakshas is such a one''; <tt>p\u00e1rvatasya p\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dh\u00e9</tt> (RV.) ''on the ridge of the mountain''; <tt>vid\u00e1the santu dev\u0101\u0301\u1e25</tt> (RV.) ''may the gods be at the assembly''; <tt>da\u00e7ame pade</tt> (MBh.) ''at the tenth step''.\n\nb. The locative of time indicates the point of time at which anything takes place: thus, <tt>asy\u0101\u0301 u\u1e63\u00e1so vy\u00f9\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101u</tt> (RV.)

This construction is, on the one hand, generalized into an expression for ''in the matter or case of''; or ''with reference to'', ''respecting'', and takes in the later language a very wide range, touching upon genitive and dative constructions: thus <tt>\u00e9 \u2019m\u00e1m bhaja gr\u0101\u0301me \u00e1\u00e7ve\u1e63u g\u00f3\u1e63u</tt> (AV.)

On the other hand, the expression by the locative of a condition of things in which anything takes place, or of a conditioning or accompanying circumstance, passes over into a well-marked absolute construction, which is known even in the earliest stage of the language, but becomes more frequent later. Transitional examples are: <tt>h\u00e1ve tv\u0101 s\u016b\u0301ra \u00fadite h\u00e1ve madhy\u00e1\u1e41dine div\u00e1\u1e25</tt> (RV.)

''and even in the case of an offence committed, there is no anger on my part''.\n\nc.

''the night having drawn to a close, and the moon resting on the summit of the western mountain''.\n\nd. But the noun may be wanting, or may be replaced by an adverbial substitute (as <tt>evam</tt>, <tt>tath\u0101</tt>, <tt>iti</tt>): thus, <tt>var\u1e63ati</tt> ''when it rains''; <tt>[s\u016brye] astamite</tt> ''after sunset''; <tt>\u0101dityasya d\u1e5b\u00e7yam\u0101ne</tt> (S.)

It is by no means to be sharply distinguished from the ordinary construction; the two pass into one another, with a doubtful territory between. It occurs:\n\na.

Often also with nouns and adjectives in similar constructions (the instances not always easy to separate from those of the locative meaning ''with reference to:'' above, 303 a): thus, <tt>day\u0101 sarvabh\u016bte\u1e63u</tt> ''compassion toward all creatures''; <tt>anur\u0101ga\u1e41 n\u0101i\u1e63adhe</tt> (MBh.)

The prepositions construed with the locative (1126) stand to it only in the relation of adverbial elements strengthening and directing its meaning.\n\n306. Declensional forms are made by the addition of endings to the stem, or base of inflection.\n\na. The stem itself, however, in many words and classes of words, is liable to variation, especially assuming a stronger form in some cases and a weaker in others.\n\nb. And between stem and ending are sometimes inserted connecting elements (or what, in the recorded condition of the language, have the aspect of being such).\n\nc. Respecting all of these points, the details of treatment, as exhibited by each class of words or by single words, will be given in the following chapters. Here, however, it is desirable to present a brief general view of them.\n\n307. Endings: Singular. a. In the nominative, the usual masc. and fem. ending is <tt>s</tt>\u2014which, however, is wanting in derivative <tt>\u0101</tt> and <tt>\u012b</tt>-stems; it is also euphonically lost (150) by consonant-stems. Neuters in general have no ending, but show in this case the bare stem; <tt>a</tt>-stems alone add <tt>m</tt> (as in the accus. masc.). Among the pronouns, <tt>am</tt> is a frequent masc. and fem. nom. ending (and is found even in du. and pl.); and neuters show a form in <tt>d</tt>.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"237213":{"pageid":237213,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/132","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>b.

The neuter accusative is like the nominative.</p>\n\nc. The instrumental ending for all genders alike is <tt>\u0101</tt>. With final <tt>i</tt>- and <tt>u</tt>-vowels, the <tt>\u0101</tt> is variously combined, and in the older language it is sometimes lost by contraction with them. Stems in <tt>a</tt> make the case end in <tt>ena</tt> (sometimes <tt>en\u0101</tt> in V.), and those in <tt>\u0101</tt> make it end in <tt>ay\u0101</tt>; but instances occur, in the early language, of immediate addition of <tt>\u0101</tt> to both <tt>a</tt> and <tt>\u0101</tt>.\n\nd. The dative ending is in general <tt>e</tt>; and with it likewise the modes of combination of <tt>i</tt> and <tt>u</tt> final are various (and disappearance by contraction not unknown in the oldest language). The <tt>a</tt>-stems are quite irregular in this case, making it end in <tt>\u0101ya</tt>\u2014excepted is the pronominal element -<tt>sma</tt>, which combines (apparently) with <tt>e</tt> to -<tt>sm\u0101i</tt>. In the personal pronouns is found <tt>bhyam</tt> (or <tt>hyam</tt>).\n\ne. A fuller ending <tt>\u0101i</tt> (like gen.-abl. <tt>\u0101s</tt> and loc. <tt>\u0101m</tt>: see below) belongs to feminine stems only. It is taken (with interposed y) by the great class of those in derivative <tt>\u0101</tt>; also by those in derivative <tt>\u012b</tt>, and (as reckoned in the later language) in derivative <tt>\u016b</tt>. And later it is allowed to be taken by feminine stems in radical <tt>\u012b</tt> and <tt>\u016b</tt>, and even by those in <tt>i</tt> and <tt>u</tt>: these last have it in the earliest language in only exceptional instances. For the substitution of <tt>\u0101i</tt> for abl.-gen. <tt>\u0101s</tt>, see below, h.\n\nf. The ablative has a special ending, <tt>d</tt> (or <tt>t</tt>), only in <tt>a</tt>-stems, masc. and neut., the <tt>a</tt> being lengthened before it (except in the personal pronouns of 1st and 2d person, which have the same ending <tt>at</tt> in the pl., and even, in in the old language, in the dual). Everywhere else, the ablative is identical with the genitive.\n\ng. The genitive of <tt>a</tt>-stems (and of one pronominal <tt>u</tt>-stem, <tt>amu</tt>) adds <tt>sya</tt>. Elsewhere, the usual abl.-gen. ending is <tt>as</tt>; but its irregularities of treatment in combination with a stem-final are considerable. With <tt>i</tt> and <tt>u</tt>, it is either directly added (only in the old language), added with interposed <tt>n</tt>, or fused to <tt>es</tt> and <tt>os</tt> respectively. With <tt>\u1e5b</tt> (or <tt>ar</tt>) it yields <tt>ur</tt> (or <tt>us</tt>: 169 b).\n\nh. The fuller <tt>\u0101s</tt> is taken by feminine stems precisely as <tt>\u0101i</tt> is taken in the dative: see above. But in the language of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as and S\u016btras, the dative-ending <tt>\u0101i</tt> is regularly and commonly used instead of <tt>\u0101s</tt>, both of ablative and of genitive. See 365 d.\n\ni. The locative ending is <tt>i</tt> in consonant- and <tt>\u1e5b</tt> and <tt>a</tt>-stems (fusing with <tt>a</tt> to <tt>e</tt> in the latter). The <tt>i</tt>- and <tt>u</tt>-stems (unless the final vowel is saved by an interposed <tt>n</tt>) make the case end in <tt>\u0101u</tt>; but the Veda has some relics or traces of the older forms (<tt>ay-i</tt> [?] and <tt>av-i</tt>) out of which this appears to have sprung.

The ending <tt>\u0101m</tt> is the locative corerspondent to dat. <tt>\u0101i</tt> and abl.-gen. <tt>\u0101s</tt>, and is taken under the same circumstances: see above.\n\nk. The vocative (unless by accent: 314) is distinguished from the nominative only in the singular, and not quite always there. In <tt>a</tt>-stems, it is the unaltered stem, and so also in most consonant-stems; but neuters in <tt>an</tt> and <tt>in</tt> may drop the <tt>n</tt>; and the oldest language has sometimes a vocative in <tt>s</tt> from stems in <tt>nt</tt> and <tt>\u1e45s</tt>. Stems in <tt>\u1e5b</tt> change this to <tt>ar</tt>. In masc. and fem. <tt>i</tt>- and <tt>u</tt>-stems, the case ends respectively in <tt>e</tt> and <tt>o</tt>; in neuters, in the same or in <tt>i</tt> or <tt>u</tt>. Stems in <tt>\u0101</tt> change <tt>\u0101</tt> to <tt>e</tt>; derivative <tt>\u012b</tt> and <tt>\u016b</tt> are shortened; radical stems in long vowels use the nominative form.\n\n308. Dual. a. The dual has\u2014except so far as the vocative is sometimes distinguished from nominative and accusative by a difference of accent: 314\u2014only three case-forms: one for nom., accus., and voc.; one for instr., dat. and abl.; and one for gen. and loc.\n\nb. But the pronouns of 1st and 2d person in the older language distinguish five dual cases: see 492 b.\n\nc. The masc. and fem. endings for nom.-accus.-voc. is in the later language usually <tt>\u0101u</tt>; but instead of this the Veda has prevailingly <tt>\u0101</tt>. Stems in <tt>\u0101</tt> make the case end in <tt>e</tt>. Stems in <tt>i</tt> and <tt>u</tt>, masc. and fem., lengthen those vowels; and derivative <tt>\u012b</tt> in the Veda remains regularly unchanged, though later it adds <tt>\u0101u</tt>. The neuter ending is only <tt>\u012b</tt>; with final <tt>a</tt> this combines to <tt>e</tt>.\n\nd. The universal ending for the instr.-dat.-abl. is <tt>bhy\u0101m</tt>, before which final <tt>a</tt> is made long. In the Veda, it is often to be read as two syllables, <tt>bhi\u0101m</tt>.\n\ne. The universal ending of gen.-loc. is <tt>os</tt>; before this, <tt>a</tt> and <tt>\u0101</tt> alike become <tt>e</tt> (<tt>ai</tt>).\n\n309. Plural. a. In the nominative, the general masculine and feminine ending is <tt>as</tt>. The old language, however, often makes the case <tt>\u0101sas</tt> instead of <tt>\u0101s</tt> from <tt>a</tt>-stems, and in a few examples also from <tt>\u0101</tt>-stems. From derivative <tt>\u012b</tt>-stems, <tt>\u012bs</tt> instead of <tt>yas</tt> is the regular and usual Vedic form. Pronominal <tt>a</tt>-stems make the mas. nom. in <tt>e</tt>.\n\nb. The neuter ending (which is accusative also) is in general <tt>i</tt>; and before this the final of a stem is apt to be strengthened, by prolongation of a vowel, or by insertion of a nasal, or by both. But in the Veda the hence resulting forms in <tt>\u0101ni</tt>, <tt>\u012bni</tt>, <tt>\u016bni</tt> are frequently abbreviated by loss of the <tt>ni</tt>, and sometimes by further shortening of the preceding vowel.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"237374":{"pageid":237374,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/134","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>c. The accusative ending is also <tt>as</tt> in consonant-stems and in the radical division of <tt>\u012b</tt>- and <tt>\u016b</tt>-stems (and in the old language even elsewhere). Stems in short vowels lengthen those vowels and add in the masculine <tt>n</tt> (for <tt>ns</tt>, of which abundant traces remain), and in the feminine <tt>s</tt>.

In the instrumental, the case-ending is everywhere <tt>bhis</tt> except in <tt>a</tt>-stems, where in the later language the case always ends in <tt>\u0101is</tt>, but in the earlier either in <tt>ais</tt> or the more regular <tt>ebhis</tt> (<tt>\u0101bhis</tt> in the two personal pronouns; and the pronominal stem <tt>a</tt> [501] makes <tt>ebhis</tt> only).\n\ne. The dative and ablative have in the plural the same form, with the ending <tt>bhyas</tt> (in the Veda often <tt>bhias</tt>), before which only <tt>a</tt> is altered, becoming <tt>e</tt>. But the two personal pronouns distinguish the two cases, having for the ablative the singular ending (as above pointed out), and for the dative the peculiar <tt>bhyam</tt> (almost never in Veda <tt>bhiam</tt>), which they extend also into the singular.\n\nf. Of the genitive, the universal ending is <tt>\u0101m</tt>; which (except optionally after radical <tt>\u012b</tt> and <tt>\u016b</tt>, and in a few scattering Vedic instances) takes after the final vowels an inserted consonant, <tt>s</tt> in the pronominal declension, <tt>n</tt> elsewhere; before <tt>n</tt>, a short vowel is lengthened; before <tt>s</tt>, <tt>a</tt> becomes <tt>e</tt>. In the Veda, it is frequently to be pronounced in two syllables, as <tt>a-am</tt>.\n\ng. The locative ending is <tt>su</tt>, without any exceptions, and the only change before it is that of <tt>a</tt> to <tt>e</tt>.\n\nh. The vocative, as in the dual, differs from the nominative only by its accent.\n\n310.

Variations of Stem. a. By far the most important matter under this head is the distinction made in large classes of words (chiefly those ending in consonants) between strong and weak stem-forms\u2014a distinction standing in evident connection with the phenomena of accent. In the nom. and accus. sing. and du. and the nom. pl., (the five cases whose endings are never accented: 316 a), the stem often has a stronger or fuller form than in the rest: thus, for example (424), \u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e\u0928\u092e\u094d <tt>r\u0101j\u0101n-am</tt>, \u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e\u0928\u094c <tt>r\u0101j\u0101n-\u0101u</tt>, \u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e\u0928\u0938\u094d <tt>r\u0101j\u0101n-as</tt>, against \u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e <tt>r\u0101j\u00f1-\u0101</tt> and \u0930\u093e\u091c\u092d\u093f\u0938\u094d <tt>r\u0101jabhis</tt>; or (450 b) \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u092e\u094d <tt>mah\u0101\u0301nt-am</tt> and (447) \u0905\u0926\u0928\u094d\u0924\u092e\u094d <tt>ad\u00e1nt-am</tt> against \u092e\u0939\u0924\u093e <tt>mahat-\u0101\u0301</tt> and \u0905\u0926\u0924\u093e <tt>adat-\u0101\u0301</tt>. These five, therefore, are called the cases with strong stem, or, briefly, the strong cases; and the rest are called the cases with weak stem, or the weak cases. And the weak cases, again, are in some classes of words to be distinguished into cases of weakest stem, or weakest cases, and cases of middle stem, or middle cases: the former having endings beginning with a vowel (instr., dat., abl.-gen., and loc. sing.; gen.-loc. du.; gen. pl.); the latter, with a consonant (instr.-dat.-abl. du; instr., dat.-abl., and loc. pl.).</p>\n\nb. The class of strong cases, as above defined, belongs only to masculine and feminine stems. In neuter inflection, the only strong cases are the nom.-acc. pl.; while, in those stems that make a distinction of weakest and middle form, the nom.-acc. du. belongs to the weakest class, and the nom.-acc. sing. to the middle: thus, for example, compare (408) \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u091e\u094d\u091a\u093f <tt>praty\u00e1\u00f1c-i</tt>, nom.-acc. pl. neut., and \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u091e\u094d\u091a\u0938\u094d <tt>praty\u00e1\u00f1c-as</tt>, nom. pl. masc.; \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u0940\u091a\u0940 <tt>prat\u012bc-\u012b\u0301</tt>, nom.-acc. du. neut., and \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u0940\u091a\u094b\u0938\u094d <tt>prat\u012bc-\u00f3s</tt>, gen.-loc. du.; \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d <tt>praty\u00e1k</tt>, nom.-acc. sing. neut., and \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0917\u094d\u092d\u093f\u0938\u094d <tt>praty\u00e1g-bhis</tt>, instr. pl.\n\n312.

After vowel-stems, an added <tt>n</tt> often makes its appearance before an ending. The appendage is of least questionable origin in nom.-acc. pl. neut., where the interchange in the old language of the forms of <tt>a</tt>- and <tt>i</tt>-stems with those of <tt>an</tt>- and <tt>in</tt>-stems is pretty complete; and the <tt>u</tt>-stems follow their analogy. Elsewhere, it is most widely and firmly established in the gen. pl., where in the great mass of cases, and from the earliest period, the ending is virtually <tt>n\u0101m</tt> after a vowel. In the <tt>i</tt>- and <tt>u</tt>-stems of the later language, the instr. sing. of masc. and neut. is separated by its presence from the fem., and it is in the other weakest cases made a usual distinction of neuter forms from masculine; but the aspect of the matter in the Veda is very different: there the appearance of the <tt>n</tt> is everywhere sporadic; the neuter shows no special inclination to take it, and it is not excluded even from the feminine. In the ending <tt>ena</tt> from <tt>a</tt>-stems (later invariable, earlier predominating) its presence appears to have worked the most considerable transformation of original shape.\n\na. The place of <tt>n</tt> before gen. pl. <tt>\u0101m</tt> is taken by <tt>s</tt> in pronominal <tt>a</tt>- and <tt>\u0101</tt>-stems.\n\nb. The <tt>y</tt> after <tt>\u0101</tt> before the endings <tt>\u0101i</tt>, <tt>\u0101s</tt>, and <tt>\u0101m</tt> is most probably an insertion, such as is made elsewhere (258).\n\n<center>Accent in Declension.</center>\n\n314. a. As a rule without exception, the vocative, if accented at all, is accented on the first syllable.\n\nb. And in the Veda (the case is a rare one), whenever a syllable written as one is to be pronounced as two by restoration of a semivowel to vowel form, the first element only has the vocative accent, and the syllable as written is circumflex (83\u20134): thus, <tt>dy\u0101\u00f9s</tt> (i.e. <tt>d\u00ed\u0101us</tt>) when dissyllabic, but <tt>dy\u0101\u00fas</tt> when monosyllabic; <tt>jy\u0101\u0300ke</tt> when for <tt>j\u00ed\u0101ke</tt>.\n\nc. But the vocative is accented only when it stands at the beginning of a sentence\u2014or, in verse, at the beginning also of a metrical division or <tt>p\u0101da</tt>; elsewhere it is accentless or enclitic: thus, <tt>\u00e1gne y\u00e1\u1e41 yaj\u00f1\u00e1m paribh\u016b\u0301r \u00e1si</tt> (RV.)

On the other hand, two or more independent or coordinate vocatives at the beginning of a <tt>p\u0101da</tt> are regularly and usually both accented: thus, <tt>p\u00edtar m\u0101\u0301ta\u1e25</tt> ''O father!

But the texts offer occasional irregular exceptions both to this and to the preceding rule.\n\nf. For brevity, the vocative dual and plural will be given in the paradigms below along with the nominative, without taking the trouble to specify in each instance that, if the latter be accented elsewhere than on the first syllable, the accent of the vocative is different.\n\n315. As regards the other cases, rules for change of accent in declension have to do only with monosyllables and with stems of more than one syllable which are accented on the final; for, if a stem be accented on the penult, or any other syllable further back\u2014as is <tt>s\u00e1rpant</tt>, <tt>v\u0101\u0301ri</tt>, <tt>bh\u00e1gavant</tt>, <tt>sum\u00e1nas</tt>, <tt>sah\u00e1srav\u0101ja</tt>\u2014the accent remains upon that syllable through the whole inflection (except in the vocative, as explained in the preceding paragraph).\n\na. The only exceptions are a few numeral stems: see 483.\n\n316. Stems accented on the final (including monosyllables) are subject to variations of accent in declension chiefly in virtue of the fact that some of the endings have, while others have not, or have in less degree, a tendency themselves to take the accent. Thus:\n\na. The endings of nominative and accusative singular and dual and of the nominative plural (that is to say, of the strong cases: 311) have no tendency to take the accent away from the stem, and are therefore only accented when a final vowel of the stem and the vowel of the ending are blended together into single vowel or diphthong. Thus, from <tt>datt\u00e1</tt> come <tt>datt\u0101\u00fa</tt> (= <tt>datt\u00e1</tt> + <tt>\u0101u</tt>) and <tt>datt\u0101\u0301s</tt> (= <tt>datt\u00e1</tt> + <tt>as</tt>); but from <tt>nad\u012b\u0301</tt> come <tt>nady\u0101\u00f9</tt> (= <tt>nad\u012b\u0301</tt> + <tt>\u0101u</tt>) and <tt>nady\u00e0s</tt> (= <tt>nad\u012b\u0301</tt> + <tt>as</tt>).\n\nb. All other endings sometimes take the accent; but those beginning with a vowel (i.e. of the weakest cases: 311) do so more readily than those beginning with a consonant (i.e. of the middle cases: 311). Thus, from <tt>n\u0101\u00fas</tt> come <tt>n\u0101v\u0101\u0301</tt> and <tt>n\u0101ubh\u00eds</tt>; from <tt>mah\u00e1nt</tt>, however, come <tt>mahat\u0101\u0301</tt> but <tt>mah\u00e1dbhis</tt>.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"237560":{"pageid":237560,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/138","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>The general rules of accent, then, may be thus stated:\n\n317. In the declension of monosyllabic stems, the accent falls upon the ending in all the weak cases (without distinction of middle and weakest): thus, <tt>n\u0101v\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>n\u0101ubhy\u0101\u0301m</tt>, <tt>n\u0101v\u0101\u0301m</tt>, <tt>n\u0101u\u1e63\u00fa</tt>; <tt>v\u0101c\u00ed</tt>, <tt>v\u0101gbh\u00eds</tt>, <tt>v\u0101c\u0101\u0301m</tt>, <tt>v\u0101k\u1e63\u00fa</tt>.\n\na. But some monosyllabic stems retain the accent throughout: thus, <tt>g\u00f3bhis</tt>, <tt>g\u00e1v\u0101m</tt>, <tt>g\u00f3\u1e63u</tt>. For such cases, see below, 350, 361 c, d, 372, 390, 427. And in the acc. pl. the stem is even oftener accented than the ending, some words also admitting either accentuation.\n\n318. Of polysyllabic stems ending in consonants, only a few shift the accent to the ending, and that in the weakest (not the middle) cases. Such are:\n\na. Present participles in <tt>\u00e1nt</tt> or <tt>\u00e1t</tt>: thus, from <tt>tud\u00e1nt</tt>, <tt>tudat\u0101\u0301</tt> and <tt>tudat\u00f3s</tt> and <tt>tudat\u0101\u0301m</tt>; but <tt>tud\u00e1dbhy\u0101m</tt> and <tt>tud\u00e1tsu</tt>.\n\nb. A few adjectives having the form of such participles, as <tt>mahat\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>b\u1e5bhat\u00e1s</tt>.\n\nc. Stems of which the accented final loses its syllable character by syncopation of the vowel: thus, <tt>majj\u00f1\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>m\u016brdhn\u00e9</tt>, <tt>d\u0101mn\u00e1s</tt> (from <tt>majj\u00e1n</tt> etc.: 423).\n\nd. Other sporadic cases will be noticed under the different declensions.\n\ne. Case-forms used adverbially sometimes show a changed accent: see 1110 ff.\n\n319. Of polysyllabic stems ending in accented short vowels, the final of the stem retains the accent if it retains its syllabic identity: thus, <tt>datt\u00e9na</tt> and <tt>datt\u0101\u0301ya</tt> from <tt>datt\u00e1</tt>; <tt>agn\u00edn\u0101</tt> and <tt>agn\u00e1ye</tt> from <tt>agn\u00ed</tt>; and also <tt>datt\u00e9bhyas</tt>, <tt>agn\u00edbhyas</tt>, and so on. Otherwise, the accent is on the ending: and that, whether the final and the ending are combined into one, as in <tt>datt\u0101\u00eds</tt>, <tt>dhen\u0101\u00fa</tt>, <tt>agn\u012b\u0301n</tt>, <tt>dhen\u016b\u0301s</tt>, and so on; or whether the final is changed into a semivowel before the ending: thus, <tt>dhenv\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>pitr\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>j\u0101my\u00f3s</tt>, <tt>b\u0101hv\u00f3s</tt>, etc.\n\na. But <tt>\u0101m</tt> of the gen. pl. from stems in <tt>\u00ed</tt> and <tt>\u00fa</tt> and <tt>\u1e5b\u0301</tt> may, and in the older language always does, take the accent, though separated by <tt>n</tt> from the stem: thus, <tt>agn\u012bn\u0101\u0301m</tt>, <tt>dhen\u016bn\u0101\u0301m</tt>, <tt>pit\u1e5d\u1e47\u0101\u0301m</tt>. In RV., even derivative <tt>\u012b</tt>-stems show usually the same shift: thus, <tt>bahv\u012bn\u0101\u0301m</tt>. Of stems in <tt>\u00e1</tt>, only numerals (483 a) follow this rule: thus, <tt>sapt\u0101n\u0101\u0301m</tt>, <tt>da\u00e7\u0101n\u0101\u0301m</tt>.\n\n320. Root-words in <tt>\u012b</tt> and <tt>\u016b</tt> as final members of compounds retain the accent throughout, not shifting it to any of the endings. And in the older language there are polysyllable words in long final vowels which follow in this respect as in others the analogy of the root-declension (below, 355 ff.). Apart from these, the treatment of stems in derivative long vowels is, as regards accent, the same as those in short vowels\u2014save that the tone is not thrown forward upon the ending in gen. plural.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"237634":{"pageid":237634,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/139","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><center><big>CHAPTER V.</big>\n\n\nNOUNS AND ADJECTIVES.</center>\n\n321. a. The accordance in inflection of substantive and adjective stems is so complete that the two cannot be separated in treatment from one another.\n\nb. They may be classified, for convenience of description, as follows:\n\nI. Stems in \u0905 <tt>a</tt>;\n\nII. Stems in \u0907 <tt>i</tt> and \u0909 <tt>u</tt>;\n\nIII.

Stems in \u090b <tt>\u1e5b</tt> (or \u0905\u0930\u094d <tt>ar</tt>);\n\nV. Stems in consonants.\n\nc. There is nothing absolute in this classification and arrangement; it is merely believed to be open to as few objections as any other. No general agreement has been reached among scholars as to the number and order of Sanskrit declensions. The stems in <tt>a</tt> are here treated first because of the great predominance of the class.\n\n322. The division-line between substantive and adjective, always an uncertain one in early Indo-European language, is even more wavering in Sanskrit than elsewhere. There are, however, in all the declensions as divided above\u2014unless we except the stems in <tt>\u1e5b</tt> or <tt>ar</tt>\u2014words which are distinctly adjectives; and, in general, they are inflected precisely like noun-stems of the same final: only, among consonant-stems, there are certain sub-classes of adjective stems with peculiarities of inflection to which there is among nouns nothing corresponding. But there are also two considerable classes of adjective-compounds, requiring special notice: namely\u2014\n\n323. Compound adjectives having as final member a bare verbal root, with the value of a present participle (383 a ff.): thus, <tt>su-d\u1e5b\u0301\u00e7</tt> ''well-looking''; <tt>pra-b\u00fadh</tt> ''foreknowing''; <tt>a-dr\u00fah</tt> ''not hating''; <tt>veda-v\u00edd</tt> ''Veda-knowing''; <tt>v\u1e5btra-h\u00e1n</tt> ''Vritra-slaying''; <tt>upastha-s\u00e1d</tt> ''sitting in the lap''. Every root is liable to be used in this way, and such compounds are not infrequent in all ages of the language: see chapter on Compounds, below (1269).<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"237650":{"pageid":237650,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/140","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Cs\u00f6rf\u00f6ly D\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\na. This class is essentially only a special class of compound adjectives, since in the earliest Veda the simple as well as the compounded root was sometimes used adjectively. But the compounded root was from the beginning much more often so used, and the later the more exclusively, so that practically the class is a separate and important one.\n\n324. Compound adjectives having a noun as final member, but obtaining an adjective sense secondarily, by having the idea of ''possession'' added, and being inflected as adjectives in the three genders (1293 ff.). Thus, <tt>praj\u0101\u0301k\u0101m\u00e1</tt> ''desire of progeny'', whence the adjective <tt>praj\u0101\u0301k\u0101ma</tt>, meaning ''desirous'' (i.e. ''having desire'') ''of progeny''; <tt>sabh\u0101rya</tt> (<tt>sa</tt>+<tt>bh\u0101ry\u0101</tt>) ''having one's wife along''; and so on.\n\na. In a few cases, also, the final noun is syntactically object of the preceding member (1309\u201310): thus, <tt>atim\u0101tra</tt> ''immoderate'' (<tt>ati m\u0101tram</tt> ''beyond measure''); <tt>y\u0101vay\u00e1ddve\u1e63as</tt> ''driving away enemies''.\n\n325. Hence, under each declension, we have to notice how a root or a noun-stem of that declension is inflected when final member of an adjective compound.\n\na. As to accent, it needs only to be remarked here that a root-word ending a compound has the accent, but (320) loses the peculiarity of monosyllabic accentuation, and does not throw the tone forward upon the ending (except <tt>a\u00f1c</tt> in certain old forms: 410).\n\n<center>Declension I.<br />Stems (masculine and neuter) in \u0905 <tt>a</tt>.</center>\n\n326. a. This declension contains the majority of all the declined stems of the language.\n\nb. Its endings deviate more widely than any others from the normal.\n\n327. Endings: Singular. a. The nom. masc. has the normal ending <tt>s</tt>.\n\nb. The acc. (masc. and neut.) adds <tt>m</tt> (not <tt>am</tt>); and this form has the office also of nom. neuter.\n\nc. The instr. changes <tt>a</tt> to <tt>ena</tt> uniformly in the later language; and even in the oldest Vedic this is the predominant ending (in RV., eight ninths of all cases). Its final is in Vedic verse frequently made long (<tt>en\u0101</tt>).

[?], and the instr. sing.). The resolution into <tt>ebhias</tt> is not infrequent in the Veda.\n\nf. The gen. ends in <tt>\u0101n\u0101m</tt>, the final <tt>a</tt> being lengthened and having <tt>n</tt> inserted before the normal ending.

Original adjectives in <tt>a</tt> are an exceedingly large class, the great majority of all adjectives. There is, however, no such thing as a feminine stem in <tt>a</tt>; for the feminine, the <tt>a</tt> is changed to <tt>\u0101</tt>\u2014or often, though far less often, to <tt>\u012b</tt>; and its declension is then like that of <tt>sen\u0101</tt> or <tt>dev\u012b</tt> (364). An example of the complete declension of an adjective <tt>a</tt>-stem in the three genders will be given below (368).\n\na. Whether a masc.-neut. stem in <tt>a</tt> shall form its feminine in <tt>\u0101</tt> or in <tt>\u012b</tt> is a question to be determined in great part only by actual usage, and not by grammatical rule. Certain important classes of words, however, can be pointed out which take the less common ending <tt>\u012b</tt> of the feminine: thus, 1. the (very numerous) secondary derivatives in <tt>a</tt> with <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt> of the first syllable (1204): e.g. <tt>\u0101mitr\u00e1 -tr\u012b\u0301</tt>, <tt>m\u0101\u0301nu\u1e63a -\u1e63\u012b</tt>, <tt>p\u0101vam\u0101n\u00e1 -n\u012b\u0301</tt>, <tt>p\u0101ur\u1e47am\u0101s\u00e1 -s\u012b\u0301</tt>; 2. primary derivatives in <tt>ana</tt> with accent on the radical syllable (1150): e.g. <tt>c\u00f3dana -n\u012b</tt>, <tt>sa\u1e41gr\u00e1ha\u1e47a -\u1e47\u012b</tt>, <tt>subh\u0101ga\u1e41k\u00e1ra\u1e47a -n\u012b</tt>; 3. primary derivatives in <tt>a</tt>, with strengthening of the radical syllable, having a quasi-participial meaning: e.g. <tt>div\u0101kar\u00e1 -r\u012b</tt>, <tt>avakr\u0101m\u00e1 -m\u012b\u0301</tt>,<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"237711":{"pageid":237711,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/144","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><tt>rathav\u0101h\u00e1 -h\u012b\u0301</tt> (but there are many exceptions); 4. secondary derivatives in <tt>maya</tt> (1225) and <tt>tana</tt> (1245 e): e.g. <tt>ayasm\u00e1ya -y\u012b</tt>; <tt>adyatana -n\u012b</tt>; 5. most ordinal numbers (487 h): e.g. <tt>pa\u00f1cam\u00e1 -m\u012b\u0301</tt>, <tt>navada\u00e7\u00e1 -\u00e7\u012b\u0301</tt>, <tt>tri\u1e45\u00e7attam\u00e1 -m\u012b\u0301</tt>.

There are no verbal roots ending in <tt>a</tt>. But <tt>a</tt> is sometimes substituted for the final <tt>\u0101</tt> of a root (and, rarely, for a final <tt>an</tt>), and it is then inflected like an ordinary adjective in <tt>a</tt> (see below, 354).\n\n334. a. A noun ending in <tt>a</tt>, when occurring as final member of an adjective compound, is inflected like an original adjective in <tt>a</tt>, making its feminine likewise in <tt>\u0101</tt> or <tt>\u012b</tt> (367).\n\nb. For the most part, an adjective compound having a noun in <tt>a</tt> as final member makes its feminine in <tt>\u0101</tt>. But there are numerous exceptions, certain nouns taking, usually or always, <tt>\u012b</tt> instead. Some of the commonest of these are as follows: <tt>ak\u1e63a</tt> ''eye'' (e.g. <tt>lohit\u0101k\u1e63\u012b</tt>, <tt>dvyak\u1e63\u012b</tt>, <tt>gav\u0101k\u1e63\u012b</tt>), <tt>par\u1e47a</tt> ''leaf'' (e.g. <tt>tilapar\u1e47\u012b</tt>, <tt>saptapar\u1e47\u012b</tt>; but <tt>ekapar\u1e47\u0101</tt>), <tt>mukha</tt> ''face'' (e.g. <tt>k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47amukh\u012b</tt>, <tt>durmukh\u012b</tt>; but <tt>trimukh\u0101</tt> etc.), <tt>an\u0304ga</tt> ''limb, body'' (e.g. <tt>anavady\u0101n\u0304g\u012b</tt>, <tt>sarv\u0101n\u0304g\u012b</tt>; but <tt>caturan\u0304g\u0101</tt> etc.), <tt>ke\u00e7a</tt> ''hair'' (e.g. <tt>suke\u00e7\u012b</tt>, <tt>muktake\u00e7\u012b</tt> or -<tt>\u00e7\u0101</tt>, etc.), <tt>kar\u1e47a</tt> ''ear'' (e.g. <tt>mah\u0101kar\u1e47\u012b</tt>; but <tt>gokar\u1e47\u0101</tt> etc.), <tt>udara</tt> ''belly'' (e.g. <tt>lambodar\u012b</tt>), <tt>m\u016bla</tt> ''root'' (e.g. <tt>pa\u00f1cam\u016bl\u012b</tt>; but oftener <tt>\u00e7at\u00e1m\u016bl\u0101</tt> etc.). The very great majority of such nouns (as the examples indicate) signify parts of the body.\n\nc.

Endings: Singular. a. The nom. masc. and fem. adds to the stem the normal ending <tt>s</tt>. The nom. and acc. neut. is the bare stem, without ending. In the Veda, the final <tt>u</tt> of a few neuters is lengthened (248 b): thus, <tt>ur\u016b\u0301</tt>, <tt>pur\u016b\u0301</tt>.</p>\n\nb. The acc. masc. and fem. adds <tt>m</tt> to the stem. Vedic forms in <tt>iam</tt> and <tt>uam</tt>, and, with <tt>n</tt>, <tt>inam</tt> and <tt>unam</tt>, are excessively rare, and doubtful.\n\nc. The instr. fem. in the later language takes the normal ending <tt>\u0101</tt> simply, while the masc. and neut. insert <tt>n</tt> before it, making <tt>in\u0101</tt> and <tt>un\u0101</tt>. But in the Veda, forms in <tt>y\u0101</tt> and <tt>v\u0101</tt> (or <tt>i\u0101</tt> and <tt>u\u0101</tt>) are not infrequent in masc. and neut. also; while <tt>in\u0101</tt> is found, very rarely, as a fem. ending. Moreover, fem. <tt>y\u0101</tt> is often (in two thirds of the occurrences) contracted to <tt>\u012b</tt>; and this is even sometimes shortened to <tt>i</tt>. An adverbial instr. in <tt>uy\u0101\u0301</tt> from half-a-dozen stems in <tt>u</tt> occurs.\n\nd. The dat. masc. and fem. gunates the final of the stem before the ending <tt>e</tt>, making <tt>aye</tt> and <tt>ave</tt>. These are the prevailing endings in the Veda likewise; but the more normal <tt>ye</tt> and <tt>ve</tt> (or <tt>ue</tt>) also occur; and the fem. has in this case, as in the instr., sometimes the form <tt>\u012b</tt> for <tt>ie</tt>. In the later language, the neuter is required in this, as in all the other weakest cases, to insert <tt>n</tt> before the normal ending: but in the Veda such forms are only sporadic; and the neut. dat. has also the forms <tt>aye</tt>, <tt>ve</tt>, <tt>ave</tt>, like the other genders.\n\ne. The abl. and gen. masc. and fem. have regularly, both earlier and later, the ending <tt>s</tt> with gunated vowel before it: thus, <tt>es</tt>, <tt>os</tt>; and in the Veda, the neut. forms the cases in the same way; although <tt>unas</tt>, required later, is also not infrequent (<tt>inas</tt> does not occur). But the normal forms <tt>yas</tt> (or <tt>ias</tt>) and <tt>vas</tt> (or <tt>uas</tt>) are also frequent in both masc. and neut. As masc. ending, <tt>unas</tt> occurs twice in RV. The anomalous <tt>didy\u00f3t</tt> (so TS.; in the corresponding passages, <tt>vidy\u00f3t</tt> VS., <tt>didy\u0101ut</tt> K., <tt>didiv\u00e1s</tt> MS.) is of doubtful character.\n\nf. The loc. masc. and fem. has for regular ending in the later language <tt>\u0101u</tt>, replacing both finals, <tt>i</tt> and <tt>u</tt>. And this is in the Veda also the most frequent ending; but, beside it, the <tt>i</tt>-stems form (about half as often in RV.) their loc. in <tt>\u0101</tt>: thus, <tt>agn\u0101\u0301</tt>; and this is found once even in the neuter. The RV. has a number of examples of masc. and neut. locatives in <tt>avi</tt> (the normal ending and the <tt>u</tt> gunated before it) from <tt>u</tt>-stems; and certain doubtful traces of a corresponding <tt>ayi</tt> from <tt>i</tt>-stems. Half-a-dozen locatives in <tt>\u012b</tt> (regarded by the Vedic grammarians as <tt>prag\u1e5bhya</tt> or uncombinable: 138 d) are made from <tt>i</tt>-stems. The later language makes the neuter locative in <tt>ini</tt> and <tt>uni</tt>; but the former never occurs in the oldest texts, and the latter only very rarely.\n\ng. The later grammar allows the dat., abl.-gen., and loc. fem. to be formed at will with the fuller fem. terminations of long-vowel stems, namely <tt>\u0101i</tt>, <tt>\u0101s</tt> (for which, in Br\u0101hma\u1e47a etc., <tt>\u0101i</tt> is substituted: 307 h), <tt>\u0101m</tt>. Such forms are quite rare in the oldest language even from <tt>i</tt>-stems (less than 40 occurrences altogether in RV.; three times as many in AV.); and from <tt>u</tt>-stems they are almost unknown (five in RV. and AV.).<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"237721":{"pageid":237721,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/146","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>h. The voc. gunates the final of the stem, in masc. and fem., alike in the earlier and in the later language. In the neut., it is later allowed to be either of the same form or the unaltered stem; and this was probably the usage in the older time also; not instances enough quotable to determine the question (AV. has <tt>u</tt> once, and VS. <tt>o</tt> once).</p>\n\n337.

The same cases in the neuter (according to the rules given above) end later in <tt>in\u012b</tt> and <tt>un\u012b</tt>; but these endings are nearly unknown in the Veda (as, indeed, the cases are of only rare occurrence): AV. has <tt>in\u012b</tt> twice (RV. perhaps once); VS. has <tt>un\u012b</tt> once; RV. has <tt>u\u012b</tt> from one <tt>u</tt>-stem, and <tt>\u012b</tt>, once shortened to <tt>i</tt>, from one or two <tt>i</tt>-stems.\n\nb. The unvarying ending of instr.-dat.-abl., in all genders, is <tt>bhy\u0101m</tt> added to the unchanged stem.\n\nc. The gen.-loc. of all ages add <tt>os</tt> to the stem in masc. and fem.; in the neut., the later language interposes, as elsewhere in the weakest cases, a <tt>n</tt>; probably in the earlier Vedic the form would be like that of the other genders; but the only occurrence noted is one <tt>unos</tt> in AV.\n\n338. Plural. a. The nom.-voc. masc. and fem. adds the normal ending <tt>as</tt> to the gunated stem-final, making <tt>ayas</tt> and <tt>avas</tt>. The exceptions in the Veda are very few: one word (<tt>ari</tt>) has <tt>ias</tt> in both genders, and a few feminines have <tt>\u012bs</tt> (like <tt>\u012b</tt>-stems); a very few <tt>u</tt>-stems have <tt>uas</tt>. The neut. nom.-acc. ends later in <tt>\u012bni</tt> and <tt>\u016bni</tt> (like <tt>\u0101ni</tt> from <tt>a</tt>: 329 c); but the Veda has <tt>\u012b</tt> and <tt>i</tt> (about equally frequent) much oftener than <tt>\u012bni</tt>; and <tt>\u016b</tt> and (more usually) <tt>u</tt>, more than half as often as <tt>\u016bni</tt>.\n\nb. The accus. masc. ends in <tt>\u012bn</tt> and <tt>\u016bn</tt>, for older <tt>\u012bns</tt> and <tt>\u016bns</tt>, of which plain traces remain in the Veda in nearly half the instances of occurrence, and even not infrequently in the later language, in the guise of phonetic combination (208 ff.). The accus. fem. ends in <tt>\u012bs</tt> and <tt>\u016bs</tt>. But both masc. and fem. forms in <tt>ias</tt> and <tt>uas</tt> are found sparingly in the Veda.\n\nc. The instr. of all genders adds <tt>bhis</tt> to the stem.\n\nd. The dat.-abl. of all genders adds <tt>bhyas</tt> (in V., almost never <tt>bhias</tt>) to the stem.\n\ne. The gen. of all genders is made alike in <tt>\u012bn\u0101m</tt> and <tt>\u016bn\u0101m</tt> (of which the <tt>\u0101</tt> is not seldom, in the Veda, to be resolved into <tt>aam</tt>). Stems with accented final in the later language may, and in the earlier always do, throw forward the accent upon the ending.\n\nf. The loc. of all genders adds <tt>su</tt> (as <tt>\u1e63u</tt>: 180) to the stem-final.\n\ng. The accent is in accordance with the general rules already laid down, and there are no irregularities calling for special notice.\n\n399. Examples of declension.

''friend'' has for the five strong cases a peculiarly strengthened base (vriddhied), namely <tt>s\u00e1kh\u0101y</tt>, which in the nom. sing. is reduced to <tt>s\u00e1kh\u0101</tt> (without ending), and in the other cases takes the normal endings. The instr. and dat. sing. have the normal endings simply, without inserted <tt>n</tt> or <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>; the abl.-gen. sing. adds <tt>us</tt>; and the loc. sing. adds <tt>\u0101u</tt>: the rest is like <tt>agn\u00ed</tt>. Thus:\n\nSing. <tt>s\u00e1kh\u0101</tt>, <tt>s\u00e1kh\u0101yam</tt>, <tt>s\u00e1khy\u0101</tt>, <tt>s\u00e1khye</tt>, <tt>s\u00e1khyus</tt>, <tt>s\u00e1khy\u0101u</tt>, <tt>s\u00e1khe</tt>; Du. <tt>s\u00e1kh\u0101y\u0101u</tt>, <tt>s\u00e1khibhy\u0101m</tt>, <tt>s\u00e1khyos</tt>; Pl. <tt>s\u00e1kh\u0101yas</tt>, <tt>s\u00e1kh\u012bn</tt>, etc. etc.\n\nb. The Veda has usually <tt>s\u00e1kh\u0101y\u0101</tt> du., and often resolves the <tt>y</tt> to <tt>i</tt>, in <tt>s\u00e1khi\u0101</tt>, <tt>s\u00e1khius</tt>, etc. The compounds are usually declined like the simple word, unless (1315 b) <tt>sakha</tt> be substituted.\n\nc. There is a corresponding fem., <tt>sakh\u012b</tt> (declined like <tt>dev\u012b</tt>: 364); but the forms of <tt>sakhi</tt> are also sometimes found used with feminine value.\n\nd. <tt>P\u00e1ti</tt> m. is declined regularly in composition, and when it has the meaning ''lord, master''; when uncompounded and when meaning ''husband'', it is inflected like <tt>s\u00e1khi</tt> in the instr., dat., abl.-gen., and loc. sing., forming <tt>p\u00e1ty\u0101</tt>, <tt>p\u00e1tye</tt>, <tt>p\u00e1tyus</tt>, <tt>p\u00e1ty\u0101u</tt>. There are occasional instances of confusion of the two classes of forms.\n\ne. For <tt>pati</tt> as the final member of a possessive compound is regularly and usually substituted <tt>patn\u012b</tt> in the fem.: thus, <tt>j\u012bvapatn\u012b</tt> ''having a living husband''; <tt>d\u0101sapatn\u012b</tt> ''having a barbarian for master''.\n\nf. <tt>J\u00e1ni</tt> f. ''wife'' has the gen. sing. <tt>j\u00e1nyus</tt> in the Veda.\n\ng. <tt>Ar\u00ed</tt> ''eager, greedy, hostile'' has in the Veda <tt>ary\u00e1s</tt> in pl. nom. and accus., masc. and fem. Its accus. sing. is <tt>ar\u00edm</tt> or <tt>ary\u00e1m</tt>.\n\nh. <tt>V\u00ed</tt> ''bird'' has in RV. the nom. <tt>v\u00e9s</tt> (beside <tt>v\u00eds</tt>). In the plural it accents <tt>v\u00edbhis</tt>, <tt>v\u00edbhyas</tt>, but <tt>v\u012bn\u0101\u0301m</tt>.\n\ni. The stems <tt>\u00e1k\u1e63i</tt> ''eye'', <tt>\u00e1sthi</tt> ''bone'', <tt>d\u00e1dhi</tt> ''curds'', and <tt>s\u00e1kthi</tt> ''thigh'', are defective, their forms exchanging with and complementing forms from stems in <tt>\u00e1n</tt> (<tt>ak\u1e63\u00e1n</tt> etc.): see the stems in <tt>an</tt>, below (431).\n\nj. The stem <tt>path\u00ed</tt> ''road'' is used to make up part of the inflection of <tt>p\u00e1than</tt>: see below, 433.\n\nk. <tt>Kr\u00f3\u1e63\u1e6du</tt> m. ''jackal'' lacks the strong cases, for which the corresponding forms of <tt>kro\u1e63\u1e6d\u1e5b\u0301</tt> are substituted.\n\n<center>Adjectives.</center>\n\n344. Original adjectives stems in <tt>i</tt> are few; those in <tt>u</tt> are much more numerous (many derivative verb-stems forming a participial {{hyphenated word start|ad|adjective}}<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]}}}}
