Some stems which are desiderative in form have lost the peculiarity of desiderative meaning, and assumed the value of independent roots: examples are <tt>cikits</tt>, ''cure'', <tt>jugups</tt>, ''despise'', <tt>titik\u1e63</tt>, ''endure'', <tt>b\u012bbhats</tt>, ''abhor'', <tt>m\u012bm\u0101\u1e45s</tt> ''ponder'', <tt>\u00e7u\u00e7r\u016b\u1e63</tt> ''obey''. Doubtless some of the apparent roots in the language with sibilant final are akin with the desideratives in origin: e.g. <tt>\u00e7ik\u1e63</tt>, desiderative of <tt>\u00e7ak</tt>.\n\na. On account of the near relation of desiderative and future (cf. 948 b), the former is occasionally found where the latter was rather to be expected: thus, <tt>r\u0101j\u0101nam prayiy\u0101santam</tt> (\u00c7B.) ''a king about to depart''; <tt>pr\u0101\u1e47a uccikrami\u1e63an</tt> (ChU.) ''the breath on the point of expiring''; <tt>mum\u016br\u1e63ur iv\u0101 \u2019bhavat</tt> (H.) ''he was fain to die''. \n\n<center>IV. Causative.</center> \n\n1041. a. In the later language is allowed to be made from most roots a complete causative conjugation. The basis of this is a causative stem, formed by appending the causative-sign \u0906\u092f <tt>\u00e1ya</tt> to the, usually strengthened, root. \n\nb. But by no means all conjugation-stems formed by the sign \u0906\u092f <tt>\u00e1ya</tt> are of causative value; and the grammarians regard a part of them as constituting a conjugation-class, the tenth or <tt>cur</tt>-class, according to which roots may be inflected as according to the other classes, and either alone or along with others (775). \n\nc. In RV., the proportion without causative value is fully one third. The formation is a more obviously denominative one than any of the other conjugation-classes, an intermediate between them and the proper denominatives. A causative meaning has established itself in connection with the formation, and become predominant, though not exclusive. A number of roots of late appearance and probably derivative character are included in the class, and some palpable denominatives, which lack only the usual denominative accent (below, 1056). \n\nd. The causative formation is of much more frequent use, and more decidedly expanded into a full conjugation, than either the intensive or the desiderative. It is made from more than three hundred roots in the early language (in RV., from about one hundred and fifty); but in the oldest, its forms outside the present-system are (apart from the attached reduplicated aorist: 1046) exceedingly few. \n\n1042. The treatment of the root before the causative-sign \u0905\u092f <tt>aya</tt> is as follows: <noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"396877":{"pageid":396877,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/431","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><section begin=chapter15 />final of the compounded noun-stem (cf. 1091): thus, <tt>du\u1e25kh\u0101-k\u1e5b</tt>, <tt>ni\u1e63kul\u0101-k\u1e5b</tt>, <tt>\u00e7amb\u0101-k\u1e5b</tt>, and one or two others. \n\n1095. Of all the forms which constitute or are attached to the verbal system, the passive participle is the one most closely assimilated in its treatment as a combinable element to an ordinary adjective. Next to it come the gerund and the gerundives.

They will, however, be briefly described here under the usual heads. \n\n<center>Adverbs.</center> \n\n1097. Adverbs by Suffix. Classes of adverbs, sometimes of considerable extent, are formed by the addition of adverb-making suffixes especially to pronominal roots or stems, but also to noun and adjective stems. \n\na. There is no ultimate difference between such suffixes and the case-endings in declension; and the adverbs of this division sometimes are used in the manner of cases. \n\n1098. With the suffix <tt>tas</tt> are made adverbs having an ablative sense, and not rarely also an ablative construction. Such are made: \n\na. From pronominal roots, in <tt>\u00e1tas</tt>, <tt>it\u00e1s</tt>, <tt>t\u00e1tas</tt>, <tt>y\u00e1tas</tt>, <tt>k\u00fatas</tt>, <tt>am\u00fatas</tt>, <tt>svatas</tt> (not found earlier); from the pronominal stems in <tt>t</tt> or<section end=chapter16 /><noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"396941":{"pageid":396941,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/416","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\n1057. Denominatives are formed at every period in the history of the language, from the earliest down. \n\na. They are frequent in RV., which contains over a hundred, of all varieties; AV. has only half as many (and personal forms from hardly a third as many: from the rest, present participles, or derivative nouns); AB., less than twenty; \u00c7B., hardly more than a dozen; and so on. In the later language they are quotable by hundreds, but from the vast majority of stems occur only an example or two; the only ones that have won any currency are those that have assumed the character of \"<tt>cur</tt>-class\" verbs. \n\n1058. The denominative meaning is, as in other languages, of the greatest variety; some of the most frequent forms of it are: ''be like, act as, play the part of; regard'' or ''treat as; cause to be, make into; use, make application of; desire, wish for, crave'' \u2014 that which is signified by the noun-stem. \n\na. The modes of treatment of the stem-final are also various; and the grammarians make a certain more or less definite assignment of the varieties of meaning to the varieties of form; but this allotment finds only a dubious support in the usages of the words as met with even in the later language, and still less in the earlier. Hence the formal classification, according to the final of the noun-stem and the way in which this is treated before the denominative sign <tt>y\u00e1</tt>, will be the best one to follow. \n\n1059. From stems in <tt>a</tt>. a. The final a of a noun-stem oftenest remains unchanged: thus, <tt>amitray\u00e1ti</tt> ''plays the enemy'', ''is hostile''; <tt>devay\u00e1ti</tt> ''cultivates the gods, is pious''. \n\nb. But final <tt>a</tt> is also often lengthened: thus, <tt>agh\u0101y\u00e1ti</tt> ''plans mischief''; <tt>priy\u0101y\u00e1te</tt> ''holds dear''; <tt>a\u00e7v\u0101y\u00e1ti</tt> ''seeks for horses''; <tt>a\u00e7an\u0101y\u00e1ti</tt> ''desires food''. \n\nc. While in the Veda the various modes of denominative formation are well distributed, no one showing a marked preponderance, in the later language the vast majority of denominatives (fully seven eighths) are of the two kinds just noticed: namely, made from <tt>a</tt>-stems, and of the form <tt>aya</tt> or <tt>\u0101ya</tt>, the former predominating. And there is seen a decided tendency to give the denominatives in <tt>aya</tt> an active form and transitive meaning, and those in <tt>\u0101ya</tt> a middle form and intransitive or reflexive meaning. In not a few cases, parallel formations from the same stem illustrate this distinction: e. g. <tt>kalu\u1e63ayati</tt> ''makes turbid'', <tt>kalu\u1e63\u0101yate</tt> ''is'' or ''becomes turbid''; <tt>taru\u1e47ayati</tt> ''rejuvenates'', <tt>taru\u1e47\u0101yate</tt> ''is rejuvenated''; <tt>\u00e7ithilayati</tt> ''loosens'', <tt>\u00e7ithil\u0101yate</tt> ''grows loose''.

(ii. 3. 8<sup>3</sup>). Other forms begin to appear in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as: e. g. the futures <tt>gop\u0101yi\u1e63yati</tt> (\u00c7B.), <tt>megh\u0101yi\u1e63y\u00e1nt</tt>, <tt>ka\u1e47\u1e0d\u016byi\u1e63y\u00e1nt</tt>, <tt>\u00e7\u012bk\u0101yi\u1e63y\u00e1nt</tt> (TS.), the participles <tt>bhi\u1e63ajyit\u00e1</tt> (?

In the later language, also, forms outside the present-system (except the participle in <tt>ta</tt>) are only sporadic; and of tertiary conjugation forms there are hardly any: examples are the causatives <tt>dh\u016bm\u0101yaya</tt> and <tt>as\u016byaya</tt> (MBh.), and the desiderative <tt>abhi\u1e63i\u1e63enayi\u1e63a</tt> (\u00c7i\u00e7.). \n\nb.

Likewise the formation of adverbs by derivation (not essentially different from case-formation), in the chapter devoted to particles. And the formation of those declinable stems \u2014 namely, of comparison, and of infinitives and participles \u2014 which attach themselves most closely to the systems of inflection, has also been more or less fully exhibited. But the extensive and intricate subject of the formation of the great body of declinable stems was reserved for a special chapter. \n\na. Of course, only a brief and compendious exhibition of the subject can be attempted within the here necessary limits: no exhaustive tracing out of the formative elements of every period; still less, a complete statement of the varied uses of each element; least of all, a discussion of origins; but enough to help the student in that analysis of words which must form a part of his labor from the outset, giving a general outline of the field, and preparing for more penetrating investigation. \n\nb. The material from accented texts, and especially the Vedic material, will be had especially in view (nothing that is Vedic being intentionally left unconsidered); and the examples given will be, so far as is possible, words found in such texts with their accent marked. No word not thus vouched for will be accented unless the fact is specifically pointed out. \n\n1137. The roots themselves, both verbal and pronominal, are used in their bare form, or without any added suffix, as declinable stems. \n\na. As to this use of verbal roots, see below, 1147. \n\nb. The pronominal roots, so-called, are essentially declinable; and hence, in their further treatment in derivation, they are throughout in accordance with other declinable stems, and not with verbal roots. \n\n1138. Apart from this, every such stem is made by a suffix. And these suffixes fall into two general classes: <noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"397648":{"pageid":397648,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/447","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\nA. Primary suffixes, or those which are added directly to roots; \n\nB. Secondary suffixes, or those which are added to derivative stems (also to pronominal roots, as just pointed out, and sometimes to particles). \n\na. The division of primary suffixes nearly corresponds to the <tt>k\u1e5bt</tt> (more regular) and <tt>u\u1e47\u0101di</tt> (less regular) suffixes of the Hindu grammarians; the secondary, to their <tt>taddhita</tt>-suffixes. \n\n1139. But this distinction, though one of high value, theoretically and practically, is not absolute. Thus: \n\na. Suffixes come to have the aspect and the use of primary which really contain a secondary element \u2014 that is to say, the earliest words exhibiting them were made by addition of secondary suffixes to words already derivative. \n\nb. Sundry examples of this will he pointed out below: thus, the gerundival suffixes, <tt>tavya, an\u012bya</tt>, etc., the suffixes <tt>uka</tt> and <tt>aka, tra</tt>, and others. This origin is probable for more cases than admit of demonstration; and it is assumable for others which show no distinct signs of composition. \n\nc. Less often, a suffix of primary use passes over in part into secondary, through the medium of use with denominative \"roots\" or otherwise: examples are <tt>yu, iman, \u012byas</tt> and <tt>i\u1e63\u1e6dha, ta</tt>. \n\n1140. Moreover, primary suffixes are added not only to more original roots, but, generally with equal freedom, to elements which have come to wear in the language the aspect of such, by being made the basis of primary conjugation \u2014 and even, to a certain extent, to the bases of secondary conjugation, the conjugation-stems, and the bases of tense-inflection, the tense-stems. \n\na. The most conspicuous examples of this are the participles, present and future and perfect, which are made alike from tense and conjugation-stems of every form. The infinitives (968 ff.) attach themselves only in sporadic instances to tense-stems, and even from conjugation-stems are made but sparingly earlier; and the same is true of the gerundives. \n\nb. General adjectives and nouns are somewhat widely made from conjugation-stems, especially from the base of causative conjugation: see below the suffixes <tt>a</tt> (1148 j, k), <tt>\u0101</tt> (1149 c, d), <tt>ana</tt> (1150 m), <tt>as</tt> (1151 f), <tt>ani</tt> (1159 b), <tt>u</tt> (1178 g\u2013i), <tt>ti</tt> (1157 g), <tt>t\u1e5b</tt> (1182 e), <tt>tnu</tt> (1196 b), <tt>snu</tt> (1194 b), <tt>uka</tt> (1180 d), <tt>\u0101ku</tt> (1181 d), <tt>\u0101lu</tt> (1192 b), <tt>tu</tt> (1161 d).<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"409708":{"pageid":409708,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/448","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\nc. From tense-stems the examples are far fewer, but not unknown: thus, from present-stems, occasional derivatives in <tt>a</tt> (1148 j), <tt>\u0101</tt> (1149 d, e), <tt>ana</tt> (1150 n), <tt>i</tt> (1155 d), <tt>u</tt> (1178 f), <tt>ta</tt> (1176 e), <tt>tu</tt> (1161 d), <tt>uka</tt> (1180 d), <tt>tra</tt> (1185 e), <tt>ti</tt> (1157 g), <tt>vin</tt> (or <tt>in</tt>: 1232 b, 1183 a); from stems in a <tt>s</tt> apparently of aoristic character (besides infinitives and gerundives), occasional derivatives in <tt>a</tt> (1148 j), <tt>ana</tt> (1150 j), <tt>ani</tt> (1159 b), <tt>an</tt> (1160 a), <tt>\u0101na</tt> (1175), <tt>as</tt> (1151 c), <tt>\u012b</tt> (1156 b), <tt>i\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> (1184 a), <tt>u</tt> (1178 f), <tt>us</tt> (1154 a), <tt>t\u1e5b</tt> (1182 e), <tt>in</tt> (1183 a). \n\n1141. The primary suffixes are added also to roots as compounded with the verbal prefixes. \n\na. Whatever, namely, may have been originally and strictly the mode of production of the derivatives with prefixes, it is throughout the recorded life of the language as if the root and its prefix or prefixes constituted a unity, from which a derivative is formed in the same manner as from the simple root, with that modification of the radical meaning which appears also in the proper verbal forms as compounded with the same prefixes. \n\nb. Not derivatives of every kind are thus made; but, in the main, those classes which have most of the verbal force, or which are most akin in value with infinitives and participles. \n\nc. The occurrence of such derivatives with prefixes, and their accent, will be noted under each suffix below. They are chiefly (in nearly the order of their comparative frequency), besides root-stems, those in <tt>a</tt>, in <tt>ana</tt>, in <tt>ti</tt>, in <tt>tar</tt> and <tt>tra</tt>, and in <tt>in, ya, van</tt> and <tt>man, i</tt> and <tt>u, as</tt>, and a few others. \n\n1142. The suffixes of both classes are sometimes joined to their primitives by a preceding union-vowel \u2014 that is to say, by one which wears that aspect, and, in our ignorance or uncertainty as to its real origin, may most conveniently and safely be called by that name. The line between these vowels and those deserving to be ranked as of organic suffixal character cannot be sharply drawn. \n\nEach of the two great classes will now be taken up by itself, for more particular consideration. \n\n<center>A. Primary Derivatives.</center> \n\n1143. Form of root. The form of root to which a primary suffix is added is liable to more or less variation. Thus: \n\na. By far the most frequent is a strengthening change, by <tt>gu\u1e47a-</tt> or <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt>-increment. The former may occur under all circumstances (except, of course, where <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-change is in general forbidden: 235, 240): thus, <tt>v\u00e9da</tt> from \u221a<tt>vid, m\u00f3da</tt> from \u221a<tt>mud, v\u00e1rdha</tt> from \u221av\u1e5bdh;<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"409718":{"pageid":409718,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/450","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>may in the main be viewed as modifications or specializations of these two. \n\na. Even the words indicating recipience of action, the passive participles, are, as their use also as neuter or reflexive shows, only notably modified words of agency. The gerundives are, as was pointed out above (961 ff.), secondary derivatives, originally indicating only ''concerned with the action''. \n\n1146. But these two classes, in the processes of formation, are not held sharply apart. There is hardly a suffix by which action-nouns are formed which does not also make agent-nouns or adjectives; although there are not a few by which are made only the latter. In treating them in detail below, we will first take up the suffixes by which derivatives of both classes are made, and then those forming only agent-nouns. \n\na.

They are used especially (in the later language, almost solely) as finals of compounds, and have both fundamental values, as action-nouns (frequently as infinitives: 971), and as agent-nouns and adjectives (often governing an accusative: 271 e). As action-nouns, they are chiefly feminines (384; in many instances, however, they do not occur in situations that determine the gender).<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"415847":{"pageid":415847,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/401","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\nc.

Reversion to guttural form of an initial after the reduplication is seen in <tt>cik\u012b\u1e63a</tt> from \u221a<tt>ci, cikitsa</tt> from \u221a<tt>cit, jig\u012b\u1e63a</tt> from \u221a<tt>ji, jigh\u0101\u1e45sa</tt> from \u221a<tt>han</tt>; and \u221a<tt>hi</tt> is said to make <tt>jigh\u012b\u1e63a</tt> (no occurrence).\n\ng. The roots <tt>van</tt> and <tt>san</tt> make <tt>viv\u0101sa</tt> and <tt>si\u1e63\u0101sa</tt>, from the root-forms <tt>v\u0101</tt> and <tt>s\u0101</tt>.\n\nh.

Initial <tt>s</tt> is usually left unchanged to <tt>\u1e63</tt> after the reduplication when the desiderative sign has <tt>\u1e63</tt> (184e): thus, <tt>sisan\u0304k\u1e63a</tt> (\u00c7B.: \u221a<tt>sa\u00f1j</tt>), and <tt>susy\u016b\u1e63a</tt> and <tt>sisani\u1e63a</tt>, according to the grammarians; but <tt>tu\u1e63\u1e6d\u016b\u1e63a</tt> is met with.\n\nj. Further may be mentioned as prescribed by the grammarians: <tt>ninan\u0304k\u1e63a</tt> (or <tt>nina\u00e7i\u1e63a</tt>) from \u221a<tt>n\u0101\u00e7</tt> ''be lost''; <tt>miman\u0304k\u1e63a</tt> from \u221a<tt>majj</tt> (occurs in <tt>miman\u0304k\u1e63u</tt>); <tt>mim\u0101rji\u1e63a</tt> (or <tt>mim\u1e5bk\u1e63a</tt>) from \u221a<tt>m\u1e5bj</tt>.\n\n1029. The consonant of the reduplication follows the general rules (590); the vowel is \u0907 <tt>i</tt> if the root has an <tt>a</tt>-vowel, or \u090b <tt>\u1e5b</tt>, or an <tt>i</tt>- vowel; it is \u0909 <tt>u</tt> if the root has an <tt>u</tt>-vowel. But:\n\na. A few roots have a long vowel in the reduplicating syllable: thus, <tt>b\u012bbhatsa</tt> from \u221a<tt>badh</tt> or <tt>b\u0101dh</tt>; <tt>m\u012bma\u1e45sa</tt> from \u221a<tt>man</tt>; and <tt>t\u016bt\u016br\u1e63a</tt> (RV.) from \u221a<tt>tur</tt>; <tt>dadhi\u1e63u</tt> (AV.) and <tt>dadan\u0304k\u1e63u</tt> (C.) are probably false forms.\n\nb. From \u221a<tt>a\u00e7</tt> is made (\u00c7B.) <tt>a\u00e7i\u00e7i\u1e63a</tt>, and from \u221a<tt>edh</tt> (VS.) <tt>edidhi\u1e63a</tt> (with a mode of reduplication like that followed sometimes in the reduplicating aorist: 862). In the older language, these are the only roots with initial vowel which form a desiderative stem, except <tt>\u0101p</tt> and <tt>\u1e5bdh</tt>, which have abbreviated stems: see the next paragraph. In the later language occur further <tt>e\u1e63i\u1e63i\u1e63a</tt> (\u221a<tt>i\u1e63</tt> ''seek'') and <tt>\u012bcik\u1e63i\u1e63a</tt> (\u221a<tt>\u012bk\u1e63</tt>); and the grammarians add others, as <tt>arjihi\u1e63a</tt> (\u221a<tt>arh</tt>), <tt>undidi\u1e63a</tt> (\u221a<tt>und</tt>), <tt>ardidhi\u1e63a</tt> (\u221a<tt>\u1e5bdh</tt>).<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"415849":{"pageid":415849,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/402","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\nc.

A number of roots, including some of very common use, form an abbreviated stem apparently by a contraction of reduplication and root together into one syllable: thus, \u0908\u092a\u094d\u0938 <tt>\u012bpsa</tt> from \u221a\u0906\u092a\u094d <tt>\u0101p</tt>; \u0926\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0938 <tt>ditsa</tt> from \u221a\u0926\u093e <tt>d\u0101</tt>.\n\na. Such abbreviated stems are found in the older language as follows: <tt>dhitsa</tt> (beside <tt>didhi\u1e63a</tt>) from \u221a<tt>dh\u0101</tt>; <tt>ditsa</tt> (beside <tt>did\u0101sa</tt>) from \u221a<tt>d\u0101</tt>; <tt>dipsa</tt> (<tt>dh\u012bpsa</tt> JB.) from \u221a<tt>dabh</tt>; <tt>\u00e7ik\u1e63a</tt> from \u221a<tt>\u00e7ak</tt>; <tt>s\u012bk\u1e63a</tt> from \u221a<tt>sah</tt>: these are found in RV.; in AV. are added <tt>\u012bpsa</tt> from \u221a<tt>\u0101p</tt> (RV. has <tt>apsa</tt> once), and <tt>\u012brtsa</tt> from \u221a<tt>\u1e5bdh</tt>; the other texts furnish <tt>lipsa</tt> (\u00c7B.) or <tt>l\u012bpsa</tt> (TB.) from \u221a<tt>labh</tt>, <tt>ripsa</tt> (GB.) from \u221a<tt>rabh</tt>, <tt>pitsa</tt> (\u00c7B.) from \u221a<tt>pad</tt>, and <tt>dh\u012bk\u1e63a</tt> (\u00c7B.) from \u221a<tt>dah</tt> (not \u221a<tt>dih</tt>, since no roots with <tt>i</tt> as medial vowel show the contracted form). In the later language are further found <tt>pitsa</tt> from \u221a<tt>pat</tt> also, <tt>j\u00f1\u012bpsa</tt> from the causative quasi-root <tt>j\u00f1ap</tt> (below, 1042 j), and the anomalous <tt>mitsa</tt> from \u221a<tt>m\u0101</tt> ''measure'' (allowed also from roots <tt>mi</tt> and <tt>m\u012b</tt>); and the grammarians give <tt>ritsa</tt> from \u221a<tt>r\u0101dh</tt>. Also <tt>mok\u1e63a</tt> is (very questionably) viewed as a desiderative stem from \u221a<tt>muc</tt>.\n\n1031. The use of the auxiliary vowel \u0907 <tt>i</tt> is quite rare in the early language, but more common later; and it is allowed or prescribed by the grammarians in many stems which have not been found in actual use.\n\na. It is declared to follow in general, though not without exceptions, necessary or optional, the analogy of the futures (934, 943 a).\n\nb. No example of the use of <tt>i</tt> is found in RV., and only one each in AV. (<tt>pipati\u1e63a</tt>), VS. (<tt>jij\u012bvi\u1e63a</tt>), and TS. (<tt>jigami\u1e63a</tt>). The other examples noted in the early texts are <tt>a\u00e7i\u00e7i\u1e63a, cikrami\u1e63a, jigrah\u012b\u1e63a</tt> (with <tt>\u012b</tt> for <tt>i</tt>, as elsewhere in this root), <tt>cicari\u1e63a, edidhi\u1e63a, jijani\u1e63a, did\u012bk\u1e63i\u1e63a, bib\u0101dhi\u1e63a, ruruci\u1e63a, vivadi\u1e63a, vividi\u1e63a, \u00e7i\u00e7\u0101si\u1e63a, ti\u1e63\u1e6dighi\u1e63a, jihi\u1e45si\u1e63a</tt>: most of them are found only in \u00c7B. Stems also without the auxiliary vowel are made from roots <tt>gam, grab, car, j\u012bv, pat, b\u0101dh, vid</tt>.\n\n1032. Inflection: Present-System. The desiderative stem is conjugated in the present-system with perfect regularity, like other <tt>a</tt>-stems (733 a), in both voices, in all the modes (including, in the older language, the subjunctive), and with participles and imperfect.

Verbal Nouns and Adjectives. These too are made with the auxiliary vowel \u0907 <tt>i</tt>, in all cases where that vowel is ever taken.\n\na.

Of other declinable stems derived from the desiderative stem, by far the most common are the adjective in <tt>\u00fa</tt> \u2014 e. g. <tt>titik\u1e63u, dips\u00fa, b\u012bbhats\u00fa, si\u1e63\u0101s\u00fa</tt> (RV. once <tt>did\u1e5b\u0301k\u1e63u</tt>) \u2014 and the abstract noun in <tt>\u0101\u0301</tt> \u2014 e. g. <tt>\u012bps\u0101, b\u012bbhats\u0101\u0301, m\u012bm\u0101\u1e45s\u0101\u0301, \u00e7u\u00e7r\u016b\u1e63\u0101\u0301</tt> \u2014 both of which are made with increasing freedom from an early epoch of the language: especially the former, which has the value and construction (271 a) of a present participle. A few adjectives in <tt>enya</tt> (having a gerundive character: 966 b) occur in the earlier language: thus, <tt>did\u1e5bk\u1e63\u00e9\u1e47ya</tt> (RV.), <tt>\u00e7u\u00e7r\u016b\u1e63\u00e9\u1e47ya</tt> (TS.), <tt>nin\u012b\u1e63e\u1e47ya</tt> (PB.), <tt>jij\u00f1\u0101senya</tt> (AB.), and, with irregular reduplication (apparently) <tt>pap\u1e5bk\u1e63\u00e9\u1e47ya</tt> (RV.), <tt>dadhi\u1e63e\u1e47ya</tt> (JB.); and <tt>did\u1e5bk\u1e63\u00e9ya</tt> (RV.) is a similar formation. RV. has also <tt>si\u1e63\u0101s\u00e1ni</tt> and <tt>ruruk\u1e63\u00e1\u1e47i</tt>, and <tt>si\u1e63\u0101s\u00e1tu</tt> (?). In the later language, besides some of the formations already instanced (those in <tt>u</tt> and <tt>\u0101</tt>, and in <tt>sya</tt> and <tt>sitavya</tt>), are found a few derivatives in <tt>aka</tt>, as <tt>cikitsaka, bubh\u016b\u1e63aka</tt>; in <tt>ana</tt>, as <tt>jij\u00f1\u0101sana, didhy\u0101sana</tt>; and, very rarely, in <tt>an\u012bya</tt> (<tt>cikitsan\u012bya</tt>) and <tt>t\u1e5b</tt> (<tt>\u00e7u\u00e7r\u016b\u1e63it\u1e5b</tt>); further, secondary derivatives (doubtless) in <tt>in</tt> from the noun in <tt>\u0101</tt>, as <tt>\u012bpsin, jig\u012b\u1e63in</tt> (one or two of these occur in the older language). And of an adjective in <tt>a</tt> we have an example in <tt>b\u012bbhats\u00e1</tt> (B.S., and later), and perhaps in <tt>avalipsa</tt> (AVP.); such words as <tt>ajugupsa, du\u00e7cikitsa</tt>, are rather to be understood as possessive compounds with the noun in <tt>\u0101</tt>. As to noun-stems in <tt>is</tt>, see 392 d.\n\n1039. Derivative or Tertiary Conjugations. A passive is allowed to be made, by adding the passive-sign \u092f <tt>y\u00e1</tt> to the desiderative root (or stem without final <tt>a</tt>): thus, \u0908\u092a\u094d\u0938\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947 <tt>\u012bpsy\u00e1te</tt> ''it is desired to be obtained''; \u2014 and a causative, by adding in like manner the causative-sign \u0905\u092f <tt>\u00e1ya</tt> (1041): thus, \u0908\u092a\u094d\u0938\u092f\u093e\u092e\u093f <tt>\u012bps\u00e1y\u0101mi</tt> ''I cause to desire obtainment''.\n\na. Of these formations in the older language are found <tt>m\u012bm\u0101\u1e45sy\u00e1m\u0101na</tt> (doubtless to be read for -<tt>s\u00e1m\u0101na</tt>, AV.), <tt>lipsy\u00e1m\u0101na</tt> (\u00c7B.), and <tt>rurutsyam\u0101na</tt> (K.). Half-a-dozen such passives are quotable later, and one or two causatives: e. g. <tt>cikitsyate, vivak\u1e63yate, jij\u00f1\u0101syate</tt>; <tt>cik\u012br\u1e63ayant, cikitsayi\u1e63yati</tt>.\n\nb.

But a few roots lack the strengthening: these are, in the older language, <tt>cit</tt> (<tt>citaya</tt> and <tt>cetaya</tt>), <tt>i\u1e63, i\u1e37, ri\u1e63</tt> (<tt>ri\u1e63aya</tt> and <tt>re\u1e63aya</tt>), <tt>vip</tt> (<tt>vipaya</tt> and <tt>vepaya</tt>), <tt>tuj, tur, tu\u1e63</tt> (<tt>tu\u1e63aya</tt> and <tt>to\u1e63aya</tt>), <tt>dyut</tt> (<tt>dyutaya</tt> and <tt>dyotaya</tt>), <tt>ruc</tt> (<tt>rucaya</tt> and <tt>rocaya</tt>), <tt>\u00e7uc</tt> (<tt>\u00e7ucaya</tt> and <tt>\u00e7ocaya</tt>), <tt>\u00e7ubh</tt> (<tt>cubhaya</tt> and <tt>\u00e7obhaya</tt>), <tt>k\u1e5bp, m\u1e5b\u1e0d, sp\u1e5bh</tt>; and <tt>grabh</tt> makes in RV. <tt>g\u1e5bbhaya</tt>. <tt>Du\u1e63</tt> and <tt>guh</tt> lengthen the vowel instead. <tt>M\u1e5bj</tt> sometimes has <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt>, as in other forms: thus, <tt>m\u0101rjaya</tt> (beside <tt>marjaya</tt>). On the other hand, <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt> appears irregularly (240 b) in <tt>srevaya</tt> (beside <tt>\u00e7r\u012bvaya</tt>), <tt>he\u1e0daya, mek\u1e63aya</tt>. Similar irregularities in the later language are <tt>giraya, tulaya</tt> (also <tt>tolaya</tt>), <tt>churaya</tt> (also <tt>choraya</tt>), <tt>mu\u1e63aya, sphuraya</tt>. No forms without strengthening have a causative value made in the older language.\n\nc. A final vowel has the <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt>-strengthening: thus, <tt>c\u0101yaya, \u00e7\u0101yaya, cy\u0101vaya, bh\u0101vaya, dh\u0101raya, s\u0101raya</tt>.  \n\nd. But no root in <tt>i</tt> or <tt>\u012b</tt> has <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt> in the Veda (unless <tt>p\u0101yaya</tt> [k, below] comes from <tt>p\u012b</tt> rather than <tt>p\u0101</tt>) \u2014 as, indeed, regular causatives from such roots are hardly quotable: only RV. has <tt>k\u1e63ayaya</tt> (beside <tt>k\u1e63epaya</tt>) from \u221a<tt>k\u1e63i</tt> ''possess''; for a few alternatively permitted forms, see below, 1.

A few roots have a form also with <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening: thus, <tt>cyu, dru, plu, yu</tt> ''separate'', <tt>\u00e7ru, p\u016b, stu, sru</tt>; <tt>j\u1e5b</tt> ''waste away'', <tt>d\u1e5b</tt> ''pierce'', <tt>s\u1e5b, sm\u1e5b, h\u1e5b</tt>; <tt>v\u1e5b</tt> ''choose'' makes <tt>varaya</tt> later (it is not found in V.: epic also <tt>v\u0101raya</tt>).\n\nf. A medial or initial <tt>a</tt> in a light syllable is sometimes lengthened, and sometimes remains unchanged: thus, <tt>bh\u0101jaya, sv\u0101paya, \u0101daya</tt>; <tt>janaya, \u00e7rathaya, anaya</tt> (but <tt>mandaya, valgaya, bhak\u1e63aya</tt>).\n\ng. The roots in the older language which keep their short <tt>a</tt> are <tt>jan, pan, svan, dhan, ran, stan, gam</tt> (<tt>g\u0101maya</tt> once in RV.), <tt>tam, dam, raj</tt> (usually <tt>ra\u00f1jaya</tt>), <tt>prath, \u00e7rath, \u00e7nath, vyath, svad, chad</tt> ''please'' (also <tt>chandaya</tt>), <tt>nad, dhvas</tt> (also <tt>dhva\u1e45saya</tt>), <tt>rah, mah</tt> (also <tt>ma\u1e45haya</tt>), <tt>nabh</tt> (also <tt>nambhaya</tt>), <tt>tvar, svar, hval</tt>.

Other noun-derivatives from the causative stem are not infrequent, being decidedly more numerous and various than from any other of the secondary conjugation-stems.

Derivative or Tertiary Conjugations. From the causative stem are made a passive and a desiderative conjugation. Thus:\n\na. The passive-stem is formed by adding the usual passive-sign \u092f <tt>y\u00e1</tt> to the causatively strengthened root, the causative-sign being dropped: thus, \u0927\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947 <tt>dh\u0101ry\u00e1te</tt>.\n\nb. Such passives are hardly found in the Veda (only <tt>bh\u0101jy\u00e1</tt>- AV.), but some thirty instances are met with in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as and S\u016btras: examples are <tt>j\u00f1apy\u00e1</tt>- (TS.), <tt>s\u0101dya</tt>- (K.), <tt>p\u0101dya</tt>- (AB.), <tt>v\u0101dya</tt>- (TB.), <tt>sth\u0101pya</tt>- (GB.); and they become quite common later.\n\nc. The desiderative stem is made by reduplication and addition of the sign \u0907\u0937 <tt>i\u1e63a</tt>, of which the initial vowel replaces the final of the causative stem: thus, \u0926\u093f\u0927\u093e\u0930\u092f\u093f\u0937\u0924\u093f <tt>d\u012bdh\u0101rayi\u1e63ati</tt>.\n\nd.

The denominatives which are so called differ from these only in that their origin is recent and undisguised.\n\n1054. The grammarians teach that any noun-stem in the language may be converted, without other addition than that of an \u0905 <tt>a</tt> (as union-vowel enabling it to be inflected according to the second general conjugation) into a present-stem, and conjugated as such.\n\na. But such formations are rare in actual use.

From the other older texts are quotable <tt>kavy\u00e1nt</tt> (TS.), <tt>\u00e1\u00e7lonat</tt> (TB.), <tt>unm\u016blati</tt> (\u1e62B.), <tt>svadh\u0101mahe</tt> (\u00c7\u00c7S.). And a considerable number of instances, mostly isolated, are found in the later language: e. g. <tt>kalahant</tt> (MBh.), <tt>arghanti</tt> (Pa\u00f1\u00e7.), <tt>abjati</tt> (\u00c7atr.), <tt>gardabhati</tt> (SD.), <tt>utka\u1e47\u1e6dhate</tt> (SD.), <tt>jagannetrati</tt> (Pras.), <tt>keli\u00e7vetasahasrapattrati</tt> (Pras.).\n\n1055. In general, the base of denominative conjugation is made from the noun-stem by means of the conjugation-sign \u092f <tt>y\u00e1</tt>, which has the accent.\n\na. The identity of this <tt>ya</tt> with the <tt>ya</tt> of the so-called causative conjugation, as making with the final <tt>a</tt> of a noun-stem the causative-sign <tt>aya</tt>, is hardly to be questioned. What relation it sustains to the <tt>ya</tt> of the <tt>ya</tt>-class (759), of the passive (768), and of the derivative intensive stem (1016), is much more doubtful.\n\n1056. Intermediate between the denominative and causative conjugations stands a class of verbs, plainly denominative in origin, but having the causative accent. Examples, beginning to appear at the earliest period of the language, are <tt>mantr\u00e1yate</tt> ''speaks, takes counsel'', (from <tt>mantra</tt>, \u221a<tt>man</tt> + <tt>tra</tt>), <tt>k\u012brt\u00e1yati</tt> ''commemorates'' (from <tt>k\u012brti</tt>, \u221a<tt>k\u1e5b</tt> ''praise''), <tt>arth\u00e1yati</tt> or -<tt>te</tt> ''makes an object of, seeks'' (from <tt>\u00e1rtha</tt> ''goal, object''), <tt>var\u1e47ayati</tt> ''depicts'' (from <tt>var\u1e47a</tt> ''color''), <tt>kathayati</tt> or -<tt>te</tt> ''gives the how of anything, relates'' (from <tt>katham</tt> ''how?''), and so on. These, along with like forms from roots which have no other present-system (though they may make scattering forms outside that system from the root directly), or which have this beside other present-systems without causative meaning, are reckoned by the grammarians as a separate conjugation-class, the <tt>cur</tt>-class (above, 607, 775).<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"424707":{"pageid":424707,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/417","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Yann\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>recognizable in the Veda, although there also corresponding forms with short <tt>a</tt> and with long <tt>\u0101</tt> sometimes stand side by side.\n\nd.

The largest class of consonantal stems are those showing a <tt>s</tt> before the <tt>ya</tt>; and, as has been seen above, a sibilant is sometimes, by analogy, added to a final vowel, making the denominative-sign virtually <tt>sya</tt><noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"424708":{"pageid":424708,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/418","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Yann\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>\u2014 or even, with <tt>a</tt> also added after an <tt>i</tt>- or <tt>u</tt>- vowel, <tt>asya</tt>; and this comes to be recognized by the grammarians as an independent sign, forming denominatives that express desire: thus, <tt>sumakhasy\u00e1te</tt> ''is merry''; <tt>j\u012bvanasya</tt>- (in -<tt>sy\u0101\u0301</tt> ''love of life''); <tt>v\u1e5b\u1e63asyati</tt> ''desires the male'' (the only quotable examples); <tt>madhu\u1e63yati</tt> or <tt>madhvasyati</tt> ''longs for honey''; k\u1e63\u012brasyati ''craves milk''.\n\n1065.

Those in <tt>anya</tt>, especially, look like the beginnings of a new conjugation-class.\n\nb. Having still more that aspect, however, are a Vedic group of stems in <tt>\u0101ya</tt>, which in general have allied themselves to present-systems of the <tt>n\u0101</tt>-class (732), and are found alongside the forms of that class: thus, <tt>g\u1e5bbh\u0101y\u00e1ti</tt> beside <tt>g\u1e5bbh\u1e47\u0101ti</tt>.

This (though almost unknown in the Veda, and coming only gradually into use in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as) is a tense widely made and frequently used in the classical Sanskrit.\n\na. It is made by prefixing the accusative of a derivative noun-stem in \u0906 <tt>\u0101\u0301</tt> (accented) to the perfect tense of an auxiliary verb: namely, of \u221a\u0915\u0943 <tt>k\u1e5b</tt> ''make'', more often of \u221a\u0905\u0938\u094d <tt>as</tt> ''be'', and very rarely of \u221a\u092d\u0942 <tt>bh\u016b</tt> ''be''.\n\nb. In the older language (see below, 1073d), <tt>k\u1e5b</tt> is almost the only auxiliary used in making this tense, <tt>as</tt> occurring very few times, and <tt>bh\u016b</tt> never. Later, also, <tt>bh\u016b</tt> is quite rare (it is found nine times in MBh., six times in Rgh., and a few times elsewhere), but <tt>as</tt> gains very greatly in currency, having become the usual auxiliary, while <tt>k\u1e5b</tt> is only exceptional.\n\nc. Somewhat similar formations with yet other auxiliaries are not absolutely unknown in the later language: thus, <tt>varay\u0101m pracakramus</tt> (MBh.), <tt>p\u016bray\u0101m</tt> (etc.) <tt>vyadhus</tt> (Viracaritra), <tt>m\u1e5bgay\u0101m av\u0101sit</tt> (ib.).\n\n1071. The periphrastic perfect occurs as follows:\n\na. It is the accepted perfect of the derivative conjugations: intensive, desiderative, causative, and denominative; the noun in \u0906 <tt>\u0101\u0301</tt> being made from the present-stem which is the general basis of each conjugation: thus, from \u221a\u092c\u0941\u0927\u094d <tt>budh</tt>, intensive \u092c\u094b\u092c\u0941\u0927\u093e\u092e\u094d <tt>bobudh\u0101\u0301m</tt>, desiderative \u092c\u0941\u092d\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0938\u093e\u092e\u094d <tt>bubhuts\u0101\u0301m</tt>, causative \u092c\u094b\u0927\u092f\u093e\u092e\u094d <tt>bodhay\u0101\u0301m</tt>; denominative \u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092f\u093e\u092e\u094d <tt>mantray\u0101\u0301m</tt>.\n\nb. The formation from causative stems (including those denominatives which have assumed the aspect of causatives: 1056) is by far the most frequent. Only a few desideratives are quotable (1034 a), and of intensives only <tt>j\u0101gar\u0101m \u0101sa</tt> (1020 a; beside <tt>jaj\u0101g\u0101ra</tt>).\n\nc. Most roots beginning with a vowel in a heavy syllable (long by nature or long by position) make this perfect only, and not the simple one: thus, \u0906\u0938\u093e\u092e\u094d <tt>\u0101s\u0101\u0301m</tt> from \u221a\u0906\u0938\u094d <tt>\u0101s</tt> ''sit'', \u0908\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u092e\u094d <tt>\u012bk\u1e63\u0101\u0301m</tt> from \u221a\u0908\u0915\u094d\u0937 <tt>\u012bk\u1e63</tt> ''see''; \u0909\u091c\u094d\u091d\u093e\u092e\u094d <tt>ujjh\u0101m</tt> from \u221a\u0909\u091d\u094d <tt>ujh</tt> ''forsake''; <tt>\u090f\u0927\u093e\u092e\u094d</tt> edh\u0101m from \u221a\u090f\u0927\u094d <tt>edh</tt> ''thrive'' (the only examples quotable).<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"424710":{"pageid":424710,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/421","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>d.

The roots (that is, stems reckoned by the grammarians as roots) of more than one syllable have their perfect of this formation: thus, <tt>cak\u0101s\u0101\u0301m</tt>. But <tt>\u016br\u1e47u</tt> (713) is said to form <tt>\u016br\u1e47on\u0101va</tt> only; while <tt>j\u0101g\u1e5b</tt> (1020) makes a perfect of either formation, and <tt>daridr\u0101</tt> (1024 a) is said to do the same.\n\nf. A few other roots make the periphrastic in addition to the usual reduplicated perfect. Thus, in the older language only are found the stems <tt>c\u0101y\u0101m</tt>, <tt>t\u0101y\u0101m</tt>, <tt>nilsy\u0101m</tt>, <tt>v\u0101s\u0101m</tt> (\u221a<tt>vas</tt> ''dwell''), <tt>vid\u0101m</tt> (\u221a<tt>vid</tt> ''know''), <tt>vyay\u0101m</tt>, and the reduplicated stems <tt>bibhay\u0101m</tt> and <tt>juhav\u0101m</tt>; the later language adds <tt>ay\u0101m</tt>, <tt>jay\u0101m</tt>, <tt>day\u0101m</tt>, <tt>nay\u0101m</tt>, <tt>smay\u0101m</tt>, <tt>hvay\u0101m</tt>, and the reduplicated <tt>bibhar\u0101m</tt>; and the grammarians teach like formations from <tt>u\u1e63</tt>, <tt>k\u0101s</tt>, and the reduplicating <tt>hr\u012b</tt>. The stem is made in every case from the present-stem, with <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt> of a final vowel.\n\n1072. The periphrastic perfect of the middle voice is made with the middle inflection of \u221a\u0915\u0943 <tt>k\u1e5b</tt>. For passive use, the auxiliaries \u0905\u0938\u094d <tt>as</tt> and \u092d\u0942 <tt>bh\u016b</tt> are said to be allowed to take a middle inflection.\n\na. One or two late examples of <tt>bh\u016b</tt> with middle inflection have been pointed out, but none of <tt>as</tt>.\n\nb. It is unnecessary to give a paradigm of this formation, as the inflection of the auxiliaries is the same as in their independent use: for that of \u221a<tt>k\u1e5b</tt>, see 800 k; of \u221a<tt>bh\u016b</tt>, see 800 d; of \u221a<tt>as</tt>, see 800m.\n\nc. The connection of the noun and auxiliary is not so close that other words are not occasionally allowed to come between them: thus, <tt>m\u012bm\u0101\u1e45s\u0101\u0301m ev\u00e1 cakr\u00e9</tt> (\u00c7B.) ''he merely speculated''; <tt>vid\u0101\u1e41 v\u0101 idam aya\u1e41 cak\u0101ra</tt> (JB.) ''he verily knew this''; <tt>prabhra\u1e45\u00e7ay\u0101\u1e41 yo naghu\u1e63a\u1e41 cak\u0101ra</tt> ''who made Naghusha fall headlong'' (Rgh.).\n\n1073. The above is an account of the periphrastic formation with a derivative noun in <tt>\u0101m</tt> as it appears especially in the later language; earlier, its aspect is rather that of a more general, but quite infrequent, combination of such a noun with various forms of the root <tt>k\u1e5b</tt>. Thus:\n\na. Of the periphrastic perfect occurs only a single example in the whole body of Vedic texts (metrical): namely, <tt>gamay\u0101\u0301\u1e41 cak\u0101ra</tt> (AV.). In the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as examples from causative stems begin to appear more freely, but are everywhere few in number, except in \u00c7B. (which has them from twenty-four roots, and a few of these in several occurrences). From desiderative stems they are yet rarer (only seven occurrences, five of them in \u00c7B.: see 1034 a); and from intensives they are unknown. The periphrastic perfects of primary conjugation were noted above (1071 f: in \u00c7B.,<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"424711":{"pageid":424711,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/422","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>eight stems and about eighty occurrences, chiefly from <tt>\u012bk\u1e63</tt>, <tt>bh\u012b</tt>, and <tt>vid</tt>; that from <tt>vid</tt> is found in the greatest number of texts).\n\nb. Forms with the aorist of the auxiliary are in the oldest Br\u0101hma\u1e47as as numerous as those with the perfect.

So also in the later language, where have been found quotable half-a-dozen such cases as <tt>vid\u0101\u1e41 karoti</tt> (Pa\u00f1c.), <tt>vid\u0101\u1e41 karotu</tt> and <tt>kurvantu</tt> (Pa\u00f1c. etc.).\n\nd. Only two or three cases of the use of <tt>as</tt> instead of <tt>k\u1e5b</tt> as auxiliary are met with in the older language: they are <tt>mantray\u0101m \u0101sa</tt> (AB.

A single example of an accented auxiliary is met with in the accentuated texts: namely, <tt>atirecay\u0101\u0301\u1e41 cakr\u00fas</tt> (\u00c7B.). As was to be expected, from the nature of the combination, the noun also retains its accent (compare 945).\n\n<center>Participial Periphrastic Phrases.</center>\n\n1074. The frequent use, especially in the later language, of a past or a future passive participle with the copula (or also without it) to make participial phrases having a value analogous to that of verb-tenses, has been already noticed (999). But other similar combinations are not unknown in any period of the language, as made with other auxiliaries, or with other participles.\n\na. They occur even in the Veda, but are far more common and conspicuous in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and become again of minor account in the later language.\n\n1075. Examples of the various formations are as follows:\n\na. A (usually present) participle with the tenses of the verb <tt>i</tt> ''go''. This is the combination, on the whole, of widest and most frequent occurrence. Thus: <tt>\u00e1yajvano vibh\u00e1jann \u00e9ti v\u00e9da\u1e25</tt> (RV.)

All the forms, personal and other, of verbal conjugation \u2014 of both primary and secondary conjugation, and even to some extent of denominative (so far as the denominative stems have become assimilated in value to simple roots) \u2014 occur very frequently in combination with certain words of direction, elements of an adverbial character (see the next chapter), the so-called prepositions (according to the original use of that term), or the verbal prefixes.\n\na. Practically, in the later language, it is as if a compounded root were formed, out of root and prefix, from which then the whole conjugation (with derivatives: below, chap. XVII.) is made, just as from the simple root. Yet, even there (and still more in the older language: 1081 a\u2013c), the combination is so loose, and the members retain so much of their independent value, that in most dictionaries (that of Sir Monier Williams is an exception) the conjugation of each root with prefixes is treated under the simple root, and not in the alphabetic order of the prefix.

Some of these, of course, are used much more widely and frequently than others. In order of frequency in the older language (as estimated by the number of roots with which they are found used in RV. and AV.), they stand as follows: <tt>pra</tt>, <tt>\u0101</tt>, <tt>vi</tt>, <tt>sam</tt>, <tt>abhi</tt>, <tt>ni</tt>, <tt>ud</tt>, <tt>pari</tt>, <tt>anu</tt>, <tt>upa</tt>, <tt>prati</tt>, <tt>ava</tt>, <tt>nis</tt>, <tt>ati</tt>, <tt>apa</tt>, <tt>par\u0101</tt>, <tt>adhi</tt>, <tt>api</tt>, <tt>antar</tt>. <tt>Api</tt> is of very limited use as prefix in the later language, having become a conjunction, ''too, also''.\n\nb. The meanings given above are only the leading ones.

Of yet more limited use, and of noun-rather than adverb-value, are:\n\n<tt>\u00e7rad</tt> (or <tt>\u00e7rath</tt>?), only with <tt>dh\u0101</tt> (in RV., once also with <tt>k\u1e5b</tt>): <tt>\u00e7raddh\u0101</tt> ''believe, credit;''\n\n<tt>hin\u0304</tt>, only with <tt>k\u1e5b</tt> (and obsolete in the classical language): <tt>hin\u0304k\u1e5b</tt> ''make the sound'', <tt>hing</tt> ''low, murmur''.\n\na. And beside these stand yet more fortuitous combinations: see below, 1091.\n\n1080. More than one prefix may be set before the same root. Combinations of two are quite usual; of three, much less common; of more than three, rare. Their order is in general determined only by the requirements of the meaning, each added prefix bringing a further modification to the combination before which it is set. But \u0906 <tt>\u0101\u0301</tt> is almost never allowed, either earlier or later, to be put in front of any of the others.\n\na.

Three or four instances have been cited from the later language of a prefix separated from, or following, a verb; perhaps the prefix in every such case admits of being regarded as an adverb.\n\n1082. As regards the accent of verb-forms compounded with prefixes, only the case needs to be considered in which the prefix stands (as always in the later language) immediately before the verb; otherwise, verb and prefix are treated as two independent words.\n\n1083. a. A personal verbal form, as has been seen above (592), is ordinarily unaccented: before such a form, the prefix has its own accent; or, if two or more precede the same form, the one nearest the latter is so accented, and the others lose their accent.\n\nb. If, however, the verb-form is accented, the prefix or prefixes lose their accent.\n\nc. That is, in every case, the verb along with its normally situated prefix or prefixes so far constitutes a unity that the whole combination is allowed to take but a single accent.\n\nd. Examples are: <tt>p\u00e1re \u2019hi n\u0101ri p\u00fanar \u00e9 \u2019hi k\u1e63ipr\u00e1m</tt> (AV.) ''go away, woman; come again quickly;'' <tt>\u00e1th\u0101\u0301 \u2019sta\u1e41 vip\u00e1retana</tt> (RV.) ''then scatter ye away to your home;'' <tt>sam\u0101\u0301cinu\u1e63v\u0101 \u2019nusampr\u00e1y\u0101hi</tt> (AV.) ''gather together, go forth together after;'' <tt>y\u00e1d g\u1e5bh\u0101\u0301n upod\u0101\u00edti</tt> (AV.)

''enveloped in which thou didst enter the waters''.\n\n1084. A prefix, however, not seldom has a more independent value, as a general adverb of direction, or as a preposition (in the usual modern sense of that term), belonging to and governing a noun; in such case, it is not drawn in to form part of a verbal compound, but has its own accent. The two kinds of use shade into one another, and are not divisible by any distinct and fixed line.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"424751":{"pageid":424751,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/427","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\na. There is in RV. a considerable number of cases (some thirty) in which the <tt>pada</tt>-text gives unnecessarily, and probably wrongly, an independent accent to a prefix before an accented verb (or other prefix): resolving, for example, <tt>\u0101\u0301r\u016bhat</tt> into <tt>\u0101\u0301 \u00e1ruhat</tt>, <tt>vy\u00e1cet</tt> into <tt>v\u00ed \u00e1cet</tt>, <tt>abhy\u00e1var\u1e63\u012bt</tt> into <tt>abh\u00ed \u00e1var\u1e63\u012bt</tt>, <tt>vy\u0101\u0301sarat</tt> into <tt>v\u00ed \u0101\u0301 asarat</tt> (instead of <tt>\u0101-\u00e1ruhat</tt> etc.).\n\n1085. In combination with the non-personal parts of the verb-system \u2014 with participles, infinitives, and gerunds \u2014 the general rule is that the prefix loses its accent, in favor of the other member of the compound. But the prefix instead has sometimes the accent: namely, when combined \u2014\n\na. with the passive participle in <tt>ta</tt> or <tt>na</tt>: thus, <tt>p\u00e1reta</tt> ''gone forth;'' <tt>ant\u00e1rhita</tt> ''concealed;'' <tt>\u00e1vapanna</tt> ''fallen;'' <tt>s\u00e1mp\u016br\u1e47a</tt> ''complete'' (cf. 1284).\n\nb. But some exceptions to this rule are met with: e. g., in RV., <tt>nicit\u00e1</tt>, <tt>ni\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u00e1</tt>, <tt>pra\u00e7ast\u00e1</tt>, <tt>ni\u1e63att\u00e1</tt>, etc.; in AV., <tt>apakr\u012bt\u00e1</tt>.\n\nc. with the infinitive in <tt>tu</tt> (972), in all its cases: thus, <tt>s\u00e1\u1e41hartum</tt> ''to collect;'' <tt>\u00e1pidh\u0101tave</tt> ''to cover up;'' <tt>\u00e1vagantos</tt> ''of descending''. The doubly accented dative in <tt>tav\u0101\u00ed</tt> retains its final accent, but throws the other back upon the prefix: thus, <tt>\u00e1nvetav\u0101\u00ed</tt> ''for following;'' <tt>\u00e1pabhartav\u0101\u00ed</tt> ''for carrying off.''\n\n1086. The closeness of combination between the root and the prefix is indicated not only by their unity of accent, but also by the euphonic rules (e. g. 185, 192), which allow the mutual adaptations of the two to be made to some extent as if they were parts of a unitary word.\n\n1087. A few special irregularities call for notice:\n\na. In the later language, <tt>api</tt>, <tt>adhi</tt>, and <tt>ava</tt>, in connection with certain roots and their derivatives, sometimes lose the initial vowel: namely, <tt>api</tt> with <tt>nah</tt> and <tt>dh\u0101</tt>, <tt>adhi</tt> with <tt>sth\u0101</tt>, <tt>ava</tt> with <tt>g\u0101h</tt> etc.: e. g. <tt>pinaddha</tt>, <tt>pihita</tt>, <tt>dhi\u1e63\u1e6dhita</tt>, <tt>vag\u0101hya</tt>, <tt>vata\u1e45sa</tt>, <tt>vad\u0101nya</tt>, <tt>va\u1e63\u1e6dabhya</tt>, <tt>vamajjana</tt>, <tt>vek\u1e63a\u1e47a</tt>, <tt>valepana</tt>. In the Veda, on the other hand, <tt>i\u1e63</tt> is in a few cases found instead (apparently) of <tt>nis</tt> with \u221a<tt>k\u1e5b</tt>.\n\nb. The final vowel of a prefix, especially an <tt>i</tt>, is (oftenest in the older language) sometimes lengthened, especially in derivative words: e. g. <tt>prat\u012bk\u0101ra</tt>, <tt>n\u012bv\u1e5bt</tt>, <tt>par\u012bh\u0101ra</tt>, <tt>v\u012br\u00fadh</tt>, <tt>adh\u012bv\u0101s\u00e1</tt>, <tt>\u00e1p\u012bv\u1e5bta</tt>, <tt>abh\u012bvart\u00e1</tt>; <tt>an\u016br\u00fadh</tt>; <tt>av\u0101yat\u012b\u0301</tt>, <tt>pr\u0101v\u1e5b\u0301\u1e63</tt>, <tt>\u00fap\u0101vasu</tt>.

Some of the apparent roots of the language have been suspected of being results of a similar unification of root and prefix: e. g. <tt>\u0101p</tt> from <tt>\u0101</tt>+<tt>ap</tt>, <tt>vyac</tt> from <tt>vi</tt>+<tt>ac</tt>, <tt>tyaj</tt> from <tt>ati</tt>+<tt>aj</tt>.\n\n\ng. The loss of the initial <tt>s</tt> of <tt>sth\u0101</tt> and <tt>stambh</tt> after the prefix <tt>ud</tt> has been noticed above (233 c). Also (137 a, c), certain peculiarities of combination of a prefix with the initial vowel of a root.\n\n\n1088.

It has been seen above that some of the prepositional prefixes are employed in combination with only very small classes of roots, namely those whose meaning makes them best fitted for auxiliary and periphrastic uses such as <tt>k\u1e5b</tt> ''make'', <tt>bh\u016b</tt> and <tt>as</tt> ''be'', <tt>dh\u0101</tt> ''put'', <tt>i</tt> ''go'' \u2014 and that the first of these are widely used in {{hws|com|combination}}<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"424755":{"pageid":424755,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/429","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{hwe|bination|combination}} with a derivative in <tt>\u0101m</tt> to make a periphrastic conjugation. Such roots have also been, from the earliest period of the language, but with increasing frequency, used in somewhat analogous combinations with other elements, substantive and adjective as well as adverbial; and this has become, in part, developed finally into a regular and indefinitely extensible method of increasing the resources of verbal expression.\n\n1091. a. The older language has a number of (mostly) reduplicative onomatopoetic compounds with roots <tt>k\u1e5b</tt> and <tt>bh\u016b</tt>, the prefixed element ending in <tt>\u0101</tt> or <tt>\u012b</tt> (generally the former): thus, in RV., <tt>akkhal\u012bk\u1e5b\u0301tya</tt> ''croaking'', <tt>ja\u00f1jan\u0101bh\u00e1vant</tt> ''flimmering'', <tt>alal\u0101bh\u00e1vant</tt> ''making merry'', <tt>kikir\u0101\u0301 k\u1e5b\u1e47u</tt> ''tear;'' in AV., <tt>ma\u1e63ma\u1e63\u0101\u0301 \u2019karam</tt> ''I have crushed;'' in VS., <tt>masmas\u0101\u0301</tt> (also TS.; MS. <tt>m\u1e5bsm\u1e5bs\u0101\u0301</tt>) <tt>kuru</tt>; in TS., <tt>malmal\u0101bh\u00e1vant</tt>; in K., <tt>manmal\u0101bhavant</tt>, <tt>kikkit\u0101k\u0101ra</tt>; in MS., <tt>bibib\u0101bh\u00e1vant</tt>, <tt>bharbhar\u0101\u0301 \u2019bhavat</tt>; in AB., <tt>babab\u0101kurvant</tt>. The accentuation, where shown, is like that of a verb-form with accompanying prefix.\n\nb. Further, combinations with \u221a<tt>k\u1e5b</tt> of utterances used at the sacrifice, and mostly ending in <tt>\u0101</tt>: thus, <tt>sv\u0101\u0301h\u0101</tt>, <tt>svadh\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>svag\u0101\u0301</tt>; also <tt>v\u00e1\u1e63a\u1e6d</tt>. In these, too, the accentuation is generally that of a verb with prefix: e. g. <tt>svag\u0101kar\u00f3ti</tt> (\u00c7B.; but <tt>svadh\u0101\u0301 kar\u00f3ti</tt> [?] TA.), <tt>va\u1e63a\u1e6dkury\u0101\u0301t</tt> (MS.); and, with another prefix, <tt>anuv\u00e1\u1e63a\u1e6dkaroti</tt> (\u00c7B.).\n\nc. An instance or two also occur of ordinary words in such combinations, put in corresponding form: thus, <tt>\u00e7\u016bl\u0101\u0301 kury\u0101t</tt> (\u00c7B.) ''may roast on a spit'' (<tt>\u00e7\u016b\u0301la</tt>); <tt>an\u1e5b\u1e47\u0101kartos</tt> (AB.) ''of getting clear of debt;'' <tt>\u0101iky\u0101bh\u0101vayant</tt> (AA.) ''uniting''.\n\n1092. a. The noun <tt>namas</tt> ''obeisance, homage'', in a still more purely noun-value, becomes combined with \u221a<tt>k\u1e5b</tt>: in the Veda, only with the gerund, in <tt>namask\u1e5b\u0301tya</tt> (beside <tt>hastag\u1e5b\u0301hya</tt> and <tt>kar\u1e47ag\u1e5b\u0301hya</tt>: above, 990 b).\n\nb. A solitary combination with \u221a<tt>i</tt> ''go'' is shown by the accusative <tt>\u00e1stam</tt> ''home''; which, appearing only in ordinary phrases in RV., is in AV. compounded with the participles \u2014 in <tt>asta\u1e41y\u00e1nt</tt>, <tt>astame\u1e63y\u00e1nt</tt>, <tt>\u00e1stamita</tt> (with accent like that of ordinary compounds with a prefix) \u2014 and in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as and the later language is treated quite like a prefix: thus, <tt>astam\u00e9ti</tt> (\u00c7B.).\n\nc. Other ordinary accusative forms of adjectives in combination with verbal derivatives of <tt>k\u1e5b</tt> and <tt>bh\u016b</tt> are found here and there in the older language: thus, <tt>\u00e7\u1e5bta\u1e41k\u1e5b\u0301tya</tt> and <tt>nagna\u1e41k\u1e5b\u0301tya</tt> (TS.); <tt>nagnambh\u0101\u0301vuka</tt>, <tt>p\u0101manambh\u0101\u0301vuka</tt> etc. (TS. et al.); <tt>\u00e1naru\u1e63karoti</tt> (\u00c7B.).\n\n1093. In the early but not in the earliest language, a noun-stem thus compounded with <tt>k\u1e5b</tt> or <tt>bh\u016b</tt> (and very rarely with <tt>as</tt>), in verbal nouns and ordinary derivatives, and then also in verbal forms, begins to assume a constant ending <tt>\u012b</tt> (of doubtful origin).\n\na. There is no instance of this in RV., unless the <tt>\u012b</tt> of <tt>akkhal\u012bk\u1e5b\u0301tya</tt> (above, 109l a) is to be so explained.

The <tt>\u012b</tt> is variously treated: now as an uncombinable final, as in <tt>\u00e7yet\u012b\u0301 akuruta</tt> and <tt>mithun\u012b\u0301 abhavan</tt> (TS.); now as liable to the ordinary conversions, as in <tt>mithuny \u00e8naya sy\u0101m</tt>, <tt>mithuny \u0101\u0300bhi\u1e25 sy\u0101m</tt>, and <tt>svy\u00e0kurvata</tt> (\u00c7B.).\n\nb. Out of such beginnings has grown in the later language the following rule:\n\n1094. Any noun or adjective stem is liable to be compounded with verbal forms or derivatives of the roots \u221a\u0915\u0943 <tt>k\u1e5b</tt> and \u092d\u0942 <tt>bh\u016b</tt> (and of \u0905\u0938\u094d <tt>as</tt> also; but such cases are extremely rare), in the manner of a verbal prefix. If the final of the stem be an <tt>a</tt>- or <tt>i</tt>-vowel, it is changed to \u0908 <tt>\u012b</tt>; if an <tt>u</tt>-vowel, it is changed to \u090a <tt>\u016b</tt>.\n\na. Examples are: <tt>stambh\u012bbhavati</tt> ''becomes a post;'' <tt>ekacitt\u012bbh\u016bya</tt> ''becoming of one mind;'' <tt>upah\u0101r\u012bkaro\u1e63i</tt> ''thou makest an offering;'' , <tt>nakhaprah\u0101rajarjar\u012bk\u1e5bta</tt> ''torn to pieces with blows of the claws;'' <tt>\u00e7ithil\u012bbhavanti</tt> ''become loose;'' <tt>ku\u1e47\u1e0dal\u012bk\u1e5bta</tt> ''ring-shaped;'' <tt>surabh\u012bk\u1e5bta</tt> ''made fragrant;'' <tt>\u0101dh\u012bkara\u1e47a</tt> ''pawning;'' <tt>\u1e5bj\u016bk\u1e5btya</tt> ''straightening;'' <tt>het\u016bkara\u1e47a</tt> ''taking as cause''. As in the case of the denominatives (1059 c), the combinations with <tt>a</tt>-stems are the immense majority, and occur abundantly (hardly less than a thousand are quotable) in the later language, but for the most part only once or twice each; those made with <tt>i</tt>- and <tt>u</tt>-stems are a very small number. In a few instances, stems in <tt>an</tt> and <tt>as</tt>, with those finals changed to <tt>\u012b</tt>, are met with: e. g. <tt>\u0101tm\u012b-k\u1e5b</tt>, <tt>yuv\u012b-bh\u016b</tt>; <tt>unman\u012b-k\u1e5b</tt>, <tt>aman\u012b-bh\u016b</tt>; final <tt>ya</tt> after a consonant is contracted to <tt>\u012b</tt>: e. g. <tt>k\u0101\u1e45s\u012b-k\u1e5b</tt>; and anomalous cases like <tt>k\u0101\u1e41di\u00e7\u012b-bh\u016b</tt> occur. Final <tt>\u1e5b</tt> is said to become <tt>r\u012b</tt>, but no examples are quotable. The combinations with <tt>k\u1e5b</tt> are about twice as frequent as those with <tt>bh\u016b</tt>, and examples with as do not appear to have been brought to light.\n\nb. Similar combinations are occasionally made with elements of questionable or altogether obscure character: e. g. <tt>urar\u012b-k\u1e5b</tt>, <tt>ur\u012b-k\u1e5b</tt>.\n\nc.

Strengthening in derivation does not stand in any such evident connection with accent as strengthening in conjugation; nor can any general rules be laid down as to its occurrence; it has to he pointed out in detail for each suffix. So also with other vowel-changes, which are in general accordance with those found in inflection and in the formation of tense- and mode-stems.\n\nc. The reversion of a final palatal or <tt>h</tt> to a guttural has been already noticed (216). A final <tt>n</tt> or <tt>m</tt> is occasionally lost, as in formations already considered.\n\nd. After a short final vowel is sometimes added a <tt>t</tt>: namely, where a root is used as stem without suffix (1147 d), and before a following <tt>y</tt> or <tt>v</tt> of <tt>van</tt> (1169), <tt>vara</tt> and <tt>var\u012b</tt> (1171), <tt>yu</tt> once (1165 a), and <tt>ya</tt> (1213 a). The presence of <tt>t</tt> before these suffixes appears to indicate an original secondary derivation from derivatives in <tt>ti</tt> and <tt>tu</tt>.\n\ne. The root is sometimes reduplicated: rarely in the use without suffix (1147 c,e); oftenest before <tt>a</tt> (1148 k), <tt>i</tt> (1155 e), <tt>u</tt> (1178 d); but also before other suffixes, as <tt>\u0101</tt> (1149 e), <tt>ana</tt> (1150 m), <tt>vana</tt> (1170 a), <tt>van</tt> and <tt>var\u012b</tt> (1169 d, 1171 a,b), <tt>vani</tt> (1170 b), <tt>vi</tt> (1193), <tt>vit</tt> (1193 b), <tt>ani</tt> (1159 b), <tt>in</tt> (1183 a), <tt>tnu</tt> (1196 a), <tt>ta</tt> (1176 a), <tt>ti</tt> (1157 d), <tt>tha</tt> (1163 a), <tt>t\u1e5b</tt> (1182 b), <tt>tra</tt> (1185 f), <tt>\u016bka</tt> (1180 f), <tt>aka</tt> (1181 a), <tt>\u012bka</tt> (1186 c), <tt>ma</tt> (1166 b).\n\n1144. Accent. No general laws governing the place of the accent are to be recognized; each suffix must in this respect be considered by itself.\n\na. In connection with a very few suffixes is to be recognized a certain degree of tendency to accent the root in case of a ''nomen actionis'' or infinitival derivative, and the ending in the case of a ''nomen agentis'' or participial derivative: see the suffixes <tt>a</tt>, <tt>ana</tt>, <tt>as</tt>, <tt>an</tt>, and <tt>man</tt>, below, where the examples are considered. Differences of accent in words made by the same suffix are also occasionally connected with differences of gender: see the suffixes <tt>as</tt> and <tt>man</tt>.\n\n1145. Meaning. As regards their signification, the primary derivatives fall in general into two great classes, the one indicating the action expressed by the verbal root, the other the person or thing in which the action appears, the agent or actor \u2014 the latter, either substantively or adjectively. The one class is more abstract, infinitival; the other is more concrete, participial.

They are formed chiefly from pronominal stems, and from other stems having a quasi-pronominal character: namely, in <tt>tra</tt>, <tt>\u00e1tra</tt>, <tt>t\u00e1tra</tt>, <tt>y\u00e1tra</tt>, <tt>k\u00fatra</tt>, <tt>am\u00fatra</tt>, <tt>any\u00e1tra</tt>, <tt>vi\u00e7v\u00e1tra</tt>, <tt>sarv\u00e1tra</tt>, <tt>ubhay\u00e1tra</tt>, <tt>aparatra</tt>, <tt>uttaratra</tt>, <tt>itar\u00e1tra</tt>, <tt>anyataratra</tt>, <tt>p\u016brvatra</tt>, <tt>paratra</tt>, <tt>sam\u0101n\u00e1tra</tt>, <tt>ekatra</tt>, <tt>anekatra</tt>, <tt>ek\u0101ikatra</tt>; in <tt>tr\u0101</tt>, <tt>asmatr\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>satr\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>purutr\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>bahutr\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>dak\u1e63i\u1e47atr\u0101\u0301</tt>. But a few in tr\u0101 come from ordinary nouns: thus, <tt>devatr\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>martyatr\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>puru\u1e63atr\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>manu\u1e63yatr\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>p\u0101katr\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>\u00e7ayutr\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>kurupa\u00f1c\u0101latr\u0101\u0301</tt>. Those in <tt>tr\u0101</tt> are distinguished from the others by their accent.\n\nb. Examples of locative construction are: <tt>h\u00e1sta \u0101\u0301 dak\u1e63i\u1e47atr\u0101\u0301</tt> (RV.) ''in the right hand;'' <tt>y\u00e1tr\u0101\u0301 \u2019dhi</tt> (RV.) ''in which;'' <tt>ekatra puru\u1e63e</tt> (MBh.) ''in a single man;'' <tt>atra m\u0101r\u0101tmake</tt> (H.) ''in this murderous creature;'' <tt>prabhutva\u1e41 tatra yujyate</tt> (H.) ''sovereignty befits him''. And, as the locative case is used also to express the goal of motion (304), so the adverbs in <tt>tra</tt> have sometimes an accusative as well as a locative value: thus, <tt>tatra gaccha</tt> ''go there'' or ''thither;'' <tt>path\u00f3 devatr\u0101\u0301 y\u0101\u0301n\u0101n</tt> (RV.) ''roads that go to the gods''.\n\n1100. One or two other suffixes of locality are:\n\na. ha, in <tt>ih\u00e1</tt> ''here'', <tt>k\u00faha</tt> ''where?'' and the Vedic <tt>vi\u00e7v\u00e1ha</tt> (also <tt>vi\u00e7v\u00e1h\u0101</tt>, <tt>vi\u00e7v\u0101\u0301h\u0101</tt>) ''always'' (compare below, 1104b); and <tt>ih\u00e1</tt> (like <tt>\u00e1tra</tt> etc.:<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"425039":{"pageid":425039,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/433","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>1099 b) is sometimes used with locative-case value: e. g. <tt>iha samaye</tt> (H.) ''at this conjuncture''.\n\nb. <tt>t\u0101t</tt>, which is added to words having already a local or directive value: thus, to adverbial accusatives, <tt>pr\u0101\u0301kt\u0101t</tt>, <tt>\u00fadakt\u0101t</tt>, <tt>t\u0101\u0301vatt\u0101t</tt>; to adverbial ablatives, <tt>\u0101r\u0101\u0301tt\u0101t</tt>, <tt>uttar\u0101\u0301tt\u0101t</tt>, <tt>par\u0101k\u0101\u0301tt\u0101t</tt>; and to prepositional adverbs, <tt>pa\u00e7c\u0101\u0301t\u0101t</tt>, <tt>adh\u0101\u0301st\u0101t</tt>, <tt>av\u00e1st\u0101t</tt>, <tt>par\u00e1st\u0101t</tt>, <tt>pur\u00e1st\u0101t</tt>, <tt>bah\u00ed\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101t</tt>. Apparently by analogy with these last, the suffix has the form <tt>st\u0101t</tt> in <tt>up\u00e1ri\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101t</tt> (and BhP. has <tt>udast\u0101t</tt>).\n\nc. <tt>hi</tt>, in <tt>uttar\u0101\u0301hi</tt> (\u00c7B.) and <tt>dak\u1e63i\u1e47\u0101hi</tt> (not quotable).\n\n1101. By the suffix <tt>th\u0101</tt> are made adverbs of manner, especially from pronominal roots or stems.\n\na. Thus, <tt>t\u00e1th\u0101</tt>, <tt>y\u00e1th\u0101</tt>; <tt>kath\u0101\u0301</tt> and <tt>itth\u0101\u0301</tt> (by the side of which stand <tt>kath\u00e1m</tt> and <tt>itth\u00e1m</tt>; and \u00c7B. has <tt>itth\u0101\u0301t</tt>); and the rare <tt>im\u00e1th\u0101</tt> and <tt>am\u00fath\u0101</tt>. And <tt>\u00e1tha</tt> (V. often <tt>\u00e1th\u0101</tt>) ''so then'' doubtless belongs with them. Further, from a few adjective and noun stems, mostly of quasi-pronominal character: thus, <tt>vi\u00e7v\u00e1th\u0101</tt>, <tt>sarv\u00e1th\u0101</tt>, <tt>any\u00e1th\u0101</tt>, <tt>ubhay\u00e1th\u0101</tt>, <tt>aparath\u0101</tt>, <tt>itar\u00e1th\u0101</tt>, <tt>yatar\u00e1th\u0101</tt>, <tt>yatam\u00e1th\u0101</tt>, <tt>katarath\u0101</tt>, <tt>katamath\u0101</tt>, <tt>p\u016brv\u00e1th\u0101</tt>, <tt>pratn\u00e1th\u0101</tt>, <tt>\u016brdhv\u00e1th\u0101</tt>, <tt>tira\u00e7c\u00e1th\u0101</tt>, <tt>ekath\u0101</tt> (JB.), <tt>\u1e5btuth\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>n\u0101m\u00e1th\u0101 </tt>(once, AV.); and <tt>ev\u00e1th\u0101</tt>.\n\nb. <tt>Y\u00e1th\u0101</tt> becomes usually toneless in V., when used in the sense of <tt>iva</tt> after a noun forming the subject of comparison: thus, <tt>t\u0101y\u00e1vo yath\u0101</tt> (RV.) ''like thieves''.\n\n1102. One or two other suffixes of manner are:\n\na. <tt>ti</tt>, in <tt>\u00edti</tt> ''thus'', very commonly used, from the earliest period, especially as particle of quotation, following the words quoted.\n\nb. Examples are: <tt>brahmaj\u0101y\u00e9 \u2019y\u00e1m \u00edti c\u00e9d \u00e1vocan</tt> (RV.) ''if they have said \"this is a Brahman's wife\";'' <tt>t\u00e1\u1e41 dev\u0101\u0301 abruvan vr\u0101\u0301tya k\u00ed\u1e41 n\u00fa ti\u1e63\u1e6das\u012b\u0301 \u2019ti</tt> (AV.) ''the gods said to him: Vr\u0101tya, why do you stand?\"'' Often, the <tt>iti</tt> is used more pregnantly: thus, <tt>y\u00e1\u1e25 \u00e7radd\u00e1dh\u0101ti s\u00e1nti dev\u0101\u0301 \u00edti</tt> (AV.) ''whoever has faith that the gods exist;'' <tt>ta\u1e41 vy\u0101ghram munir m\u016b\u1e63iko \u2018yam iti pa\u00e7yati</tt> (H.) ''the sage looks upon that tiger as being really a mouse;'' <tt>y\u016bya\u1e41 kim iti s\u012bdatha</tt> (H.) ''why'' (lit. ''alleging what reason'') ''do you sit?''\n\nc. But <tt>iti</tt> is sometimes used in a less specialized way, to mark an onomatop\u0153ia, or to indicate a gesture: e. g. <tt>bah\u00ed\u1e63 \u1e6de astu b\u0101\u0301l \u00edti</tt> (AV.) ''let it come out of you with a splash;'' <tt>\u00edty \u00e1gre k\u1e5b\u1e63\u00e1ty \u00e1th\u00e9 \u2019ti</tt> (\u00c7B.) ''he ploughs first this way, then this way;'' or it points forward to something to be said: e. g. <tt>yan nv ity \u0101hur any\u0101ni chand\u0101\u1e45si var\u1e63\u012by\u0101\u1e45si kasm\u0101d b\u1e5bhaty ucyata iti</tt> (PB.) ''when now they say thus: \"the other metres are greater; why is the'' <tt>b\u1e5bhat\u012b</tt> ''spoken?\"'' It also makes a number of derivatives and compounds: e. g. <tt>ititha</tt> ''the so-many-eth;'' <tt>itivat</tt> ''in this fashion;'' <tt>ityartham</tt> ''for this purpose;'' <tt>itih\u0101sa</tt> ''a story'' or ''legend'' (lit. ''thus forsooth it was'').

With the suffix of <tt>\u00edti</tt> is to be compared that of <tt>t\u00e1ti</tt> etc. (519). The word is abbreviated to <tt>ti</tt> two or three times in \u00c7B.\n\ne. <tt>va</tt> in <tt>iva</tt> (toneless) ''like, as'', and <tt>ev\u00e1</tt> (in V. often <tt>ev\u0101\u0301</tt>), earlier ''thus'', later a particle emphasizing the preceding word; for ''thus'' is used later the related <tt>ev\u00e1m</tt>, which hardly occurs in RV., and in AV. only with \u221a<tt>vid</tt>: as, <tt>ev\u00e1m vidv\u0101\u0301n</tt> ''knowing thus''.\n\nf. In later Vedic (AV. etc., and the later parts of RV.) <tt>iva</tt> more often counts for only a single syllable, <tt>\u2019va</tt>.\n\n1103. a. By the suffix <tt>d\u0101</tt> are made adverbs of time, but almost only from pronominal roots.\n\nb. Thus, <tt>tad\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>yad\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>kad\u0101\u0301</tt> (in RV. also <tt>k\u00e1d\u0101</tt>), <tt>id\u0101\u0301</tt> (only in V.); and <tt>s\u00e1d\u0101</tt>, beside which is found earlier <tt>s\u00e1dam</tt>. Besides these, in the older language, only <tt>sarvad\u0101\u0301</tt>; later a few others, <tt>anyad\u0101</tt>, <tt>ekad\u0101</tt>, <tt>nityad\u0101</tt>. A quasi-locative case use is seen occasionally in such phrases as <tt>kad\u0101cid divase</tt> (R.) ''on a certain day''.\n\nc. By the perhaps related <tt>d\u0101n\u012bm</tt> are made <tt>id\u0101\u0301n\u012bm</tt>, <tt>tad\u0101\u0301n\u012bm</tt>, <tt>vi\u00e7vad\u0101\u0301n\u012bm</tt>, <tt>tvad\u0101n\u012bm</tt> (toneless). <tt>Vi\u00e7vad\u0101\u0301ni</tt> occurs as adjective in TB.\n\nd. With <tt>rhi</tt> are made, from pronominal roots, <tt>t\u00e1rhi</tt>, <tt>et\u00e1rhi</tt>, <tt>y\u00e1rhi</tt>, <tt>k\u00e1rhi</tt>, <tt>am\u00farhi</tt>.\n\ne. The suffix <tt>di</tt>, found only in <tt>y\u00e1di</tt> ''if'', is perhaps related with <tt>d\u0101</tt>, in form as in meaning. <tt>Sadad\u00ed</tt> (MS.) is of doubtful character.\n\n1104. By the suffix <tt>dh\u0101</tt> are formed adverbs especially from numerals, signifying -''fold, times, ways'', etc.\n\na. Thus, <tt>ekadh\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>dvidh\u0101\u0301</tt> (also <tt>dv\u00eddh\u0101</tt> and <tt>dvedh\u0101\u0301</tt>), <tt>tr\u00eddh\u0101</tt> (in the older language usually <tt>tredh\u0101\u0301</tt>), <tt>\u1e63a\u1e0d\u1e0dh\u0101\u0301</tt> (also <tt>\u1e63o\u1e0dh\u0101\u0301</tt> and <tt>\u1e63a\u1e0ddh\u0101</tt>), <tt>dv\u0101da\u00e7adh\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>ek\u0101nnavi\u1e45\u00e7atidh\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>sahasradh\u0101\u0301</tt>, and so on. Also, naturally, from words having a quasi-numeral character: thus, <tt>anekadh\u0101</tt>, <tt>katidh\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>tatidh\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>bahudh\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>purudh\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>vi\u00e7v\u00e1dh\u0101</tt>, <tt>\u00e7a\u00e7vadh\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>aparimitadh\u0101</tt>, <tt>y\u0101vaddh\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>et\u0101vaddh\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>m\u0101sadh\u0101</tt>. In a very few cases, also from general noun and adjective stems: thus, <tt>mitradh\u0101\u0301</tt> (AV.), <tt>priyadh\u0101\u0301</tt> (TS.; <tt>predh\u0101\u0301</tt>, MS.), <tt>\u1e5bjudh\u0101\u0301</tt> (TB.), <tt>urudh\u0101</tt> and <tt>citradh\u0101</tt> (BhP.); and from one adverb, <tt>bahirdh\u0101\u0301</tt>.\n\nb. The particle <tt>\u00e1dha</tt> or <tt>\u00e1dh\u0101</tt>, a Vedic equivalent of <tt>\u00e1tha</tt>, probably belongs here (<tt>purudh\u00e1</tt> and <tt>vi\u00e7v\u00e1dha</tt>, with shortened final, occur a few times in RV.); also <tt>addh\u0101\u0301</tt> ''in truth''; and perhaps <tt>sah\u00e1</tt> ''with'', which has an equivalent <tt>sadha</tt>- in several Vedic compounds. And the other adverbs in <tt>ha</tt> (1100 a) may be of like origin.\n\n1105. From a few numerals are made multiplicative adverbs with <tt>s</tt>: namely, <tt>dv\u00eds</tt>, <tt>tr\u00eds</tt>, and <tt>cat\u00far</tt> (probably, for <tt>cat\u00fars</tt>): 489 a.\n\na. The corresponding word for ''once'', <tt>sak\u1e5b\u0301t</tt>, is a compound rather than a derivative; and the same character belongs still more evidently to <tt>pa\u00f1cak\u1e5b\u0301tvas</tt>, <tt>navak\u1e5b\u0301tvas</tt>, <tt>aparimitak\u1e5b\u0301tvas</tt>, etc., though <tt>k\u1e5bt</tt> and <tt>k\u1e5btvas</tt> are regarded by the native grammarians as suffixes; the earlier<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"425041":{"pageid":425041,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/435","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>texts (AV. \u00c7B.

The quasi-suffix <tt>dyus</tt>, from a case-form of <tt>div</tt> ''day'', is in a similar manner added to various determining-words, generally made to end in e: e. g. <tt>anyedy\u00fas</tt> ''another day'', <tt>ubhayedyus</tt> (AV. -<tt>yady\u00fas</tt>) ''on either day'', <tt>p\u016brvedy\u00fas</tt> ''the day before''.\n\n1106. By the suffix <tt>\u00e7\u00e1s</tt> are made, especially from numeral or quantitative stems, many adverbs of quantity or measure or manner, generally used distributively.\n\na. Examples are: <tt>eka\u00e7\u00e1s</tt> ''one by one'', <tt>\u00e7ata\u00e7\u00e1s</tt> ''by hundreds'', <tt>\u1e5btu\u00e7\u00e1s</tt> ''season by season'', <tt>pacchas</tt> ''foot by foot'', <tt>ak\u1e63ara\u00e7\u00e1s</tt> ''syllable by syllable'', <tt>ga\u1e47a\u00e7\u00e1s</tt> ''in crowds'', <tt>stamba\u00e7\u00e1s</tt> ''by bunches'', <tt>paru\u00e7\u00e7\u00e1s</tt> ''limb by limb'', <tt>t\u0101vacch\u00e1s</tt> ''in such and such number or quantity:'' and, in a more general way, <tt>sarva\u00e7\u00e1s</tt> ''wholly'', <tt>mukhya\u00e7as</tt> ''principally'', <tt>k\u1e5bchra\u00e7as</tt> ''stingily'', <tt>manma\u00e7\u00e1s</tt> ''as minded''.\n\n1107. By the suffix <tt>v\u00e1t</tt> are made with great freedom, in every period of the language, adverbs signifying ''after the manner of, like'', etc.\n\na. Thus, <tt>an\u0304girasv\u00e1t</tt> ''like Angiras'', <tt>manu\u1e63v\u00e1t</tt> (RV.) ''as Manu did'', <tt>jamadagniv\u00e1t</tt> ''after the manner of Jamadagni''; <tt>p\u016brvav\u00e1t</tt> or <tt>pratnav\u00e1t</tt> or <tt>pur\u0101\u1e47av\u00e1t</tt>, ''as of old'', <tt>k\u0101kat\u0101l\u012byavat</tt> ''after the fashion of the crow and the palm-fruit''.\n\nb. This is really the adverbially used accusative (with adverbial shift of accent: below, 1111 g) of the suffix <tt>vant</tt> ( 1233 f), which in the Veda makes certain adjective compounds of a similar meaning: thus, <tt>tv\u0101\u0301vant</tt> ''like thee'', <tt>m\u0101\u0301vant</tt> ''of my sort'', etc.\n\n1108. By the suffix <tt>s\u0101t</tt> are made from nouns quasi-adverbs signifying ''in'' or ''into the condition'' or ''the possession of'' what is indicated by the noun; they are used only with verbs of being, of becoming, and of making: namely, oftenest <tt>k\u1e5b</tt> and <tt>bh\u016b</tt>, but also <tt>as</tt>, <tt>gam</tt>, <tt>y\u0101</tt>, and <tt>n\u012b</tt> (and, according to the grammarians, <tt>sam-pad</tt>). Some twenty-five examples are quotable from the later literature; but none from the earlier, which also appears to contain nothing that casts light upon the origin of the formation. The <tt>s</tt> of <tt>s\u0101t</tt> is not liable to conversion into <tt>\u1e63</tt>. The connection with the verb is not so close as to require the use of the gerund in <tt>ya</tt> instead of that in <tt>tv\u0101</tt> (990); and other words are sometimes interposed between the adverb and verb.\n\na. Examples are: <tt>sarvakarm\u0101\u1e47i bhasmas\u0101t kurute</tt> (MBh.) ''reduces all deeds to ashes;'' <tt>loko \u2018yam dasyus\u0101d bhaved</tt> (MBh.)

In the epics begin to be found a small class (about a dozen are quotable) of adverbs having the form of a repeated noun-stem with its first occurrence ending in <tt>\u0101</tt> and its second in <tt>i</tt>: e. g. <tt>hast\u0101hasti</tt> ''hand to hand'', <tt>rath\u0101rathi</tt> ''chariot against chariot'', <tt>kar\u1e47\u0101kar\u1e47i</tt> ''ear to ear''.\n\nc. The adverbs thus far described are almost never used prepositionally. Those of the next division, however, are in many instances so used.\n\n1110. Case-forms used as Adverbs. A large number of adverbs are more or less evidently cases in form, made from stems which are not otherwise in use. Also many cases of known stems, pronominal or noun or adjective, are used with an adverbial value, being distinguished from proper cases by some difference of application, which is sometimes accompanied by an irregularity of form.\n\n1111. The accusative is the case most frequently and widely used adverbially. Thus:\n\na. Of pronominal stems: as, <tt>y\u00e1d</tt> ''if, when, that'', etc.; <tt>t\u00e1d</tt> ''then'' etc.; <tt>k\u00edm</tt> ''why, whether'', etc.; <tt>id\u00e1m</tt> ''now, here;'' <tt>ad\u00e1s</tt> ''yonder;'' and so on. Of like value, apparently, are the (mostly Vedic) particles <tt>k\u00e1d</tt>, <tt>k\u00e1m</tt> and <tt>kam</tt> (?), <tt>\u00edd</tt>, <tt>cid</tt> (common at every period), <tt>sm\u00e1d</tt> and <tt>sum\u00e1d</tt>, <tt>\u012bm</tt> and <tt>s\u012bm</tt> (by some regarded as still possessing pronoun-value), -<tt>k\u012bm</tt>. Compounds with <tt>\u00edd</tt> are <tt>c\u00e9d</tt> ''if'' , <tt>n\u00e9d</tt> ''lest'', <tt>\u00e9d</tt>, <tt>svid</tt>, <tt>kuv\u00edd</tt>; with <tt>cid</tt>, <tt>k\u016b\u0301cid</tt>; with -<tt>k\u012bm</tt>, <tt>n\u00e1k\u012bm</tt> and <tt>m\u0101\u0301k\u012bm</tt> and <tt>\u0101\u0301k\u012bm</tt>.\n\nb. Of noun-stems: as, <tt>n\u0101\u0301ma</tt> ''by name;'' <tt>s\u00fakham</tt> ''happily;'' <tt>k\u0101\u0301mam</tt> ''at will, if you please;'' <tt>n\u00e1ktam</tt> ''by night;'' <tt>r\u00e1has</tt> ''secretly;'' <tt>o\u1e63\u00e1m</tt> ''quickly'' (V.); and so on.\n\nc. Of adjective stems, in unlimited numbers: as, <tt>saty\u00e1m</tt> ''truly;'' <tt>cir\u00e1m</tt> ''long;'' p\u016b\u0301rvam ''formerly;'' <tt>n\u00edtyam</tt> ''constantly;'' <tt>bh\u016b\u0301yas</tt> ''more, again;'' <tt>vi\u00e7rabdham</tt> ''confidently;'' <tt>prak\u0101\u00e7am</tt> ''openly;'' and so on.\n\nd. The neuter singular is the case commonly employed in this way; and it is so used especially as made from great numbers of compound adjective stems, often from such as hardly occur, or are not at all found, in adjective use. Certain of these adverbial compounds, having an indeclinable as prior member, are made by the Hindu grammarians a special class of compounds, called <tt>avyay\u012bbh\u0101va</tt> (1313).\n\ne. But the feminine singular also is sometimes used, especially in the so-called adverbial endings of comparison, <tt>tar\u0101m</tt> and <tt>tam\u0101m</tt>, which are attached to particles (cf. 1119), and even (473 c) to verb-forms:<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"425043":{"pageid":425043,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/437","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>e. g. <tt>natar\u0101\u0301m</tt>, <tt>katha\u1e41tar\u0101m</tt>, <tt>uccaistar\u0101\u0301m</tt>, <tt>\u00e7an\u0101istar\u0101m</tt>, <tt>jyoktam\u0101\u0301m</tt>. In the oldest language (RV. and AV.), the neuter instead of the feminine form of these suffixes is almost alone in use: see 1119.\n\nf. Many adverbs of obscure form or connection are to be explained with probability as accusatives of obsolete noun or adjective stems: examples are <tt>t\u016b\u1e63\u1e47\u012b\u0301m</tt> ''in silence;'' <tt>s\u0101y\u00e1m</tt> ''at evening;'' <tt>s\u0101k\u00e1m</tt> ''together, with'' (prep.); <tt>\u00e1ram</tt> or <tt>\u00e1lam</tt> ''sufficient'' (in the later language used with \u221ak\u1e5b in the manner of a prefix: 1078 a); <tt>pr\u0101yas</tt> ''usually;'' <tt>\u012b\u1e63\u00e1t</tt> ''somewhat;'' <tt>amn\u00e1s</tt> ''unexpectedly;'' <tt>bah\u00eds</tt> ''outside;'' <tt>m\u00edthu</tt> and <tt>mith\u00e1s</tt>, <tt>m\u00fahu</tt> and <tt>m\u00fahus</tt>, <tt>j\u0101\u0301tu</tt>, and so on. <tt>Madr\u00edk</tt> etc., and <tt>ni\u1e47\u00edk</tt> (in RV.), are perhaps contracted forms of adjectives having \u221a<tt>ac</tt> or <tt>a\u00f1c</tt> as their final (407 ff.). The presence of other roots as final members is also probable for <tt>u\u00e7\u00e1dhak</tt>, <tt>\u0101nu\u1e63\u00e1k</tt> and <tt>\u0101yu\u1e63\u00e1k</tt>, <tt>anu\u1e63\u1e6dh\u00fa</tt> and <tt>su\u1e63\u1e6dh\u00fa</tt>, <tt>yugap\u00e1t</tt>, etc. Compare also the forms in <tt>am</tt> beside those in <tt>\u0101</tt>, above, 1101 a, 1102 e, 1103 b.\n\ng. In (Vedic) <tt>drav\u00e1t</tt> ''quickly'' is to be seen a change of accent for the adverbial use (pple <tt>dr\u00e1vant</tt> ''running''); and <tt>drahy\u00e1t</tt> ''stoutly'' (RV., once) may be another example. The comparative and superlative suffixes (above, e) show a like change; and it is also to be recognized in the derivatives with <tt>v\u00e1t</tt> (1107).\n\n1112. The instrumental is also often used with adverbial value: generally in the singular, but sometimes also in the plural. Thus:\n\na. Of pronominal stems: as, <tt>en\u0101\u0301</tt> and <tt>ay\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>k\u00e1y\u0101</tt>, <tt>an\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>am\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>amuy\u0101\u0301</tt>.\n\nb.

Of adjectives, both neuter (not distinguishable from masculine) and feminine: as, <tt>akhilena</tt> ''wholly;'' <tt>pr\u0101ye\u1e47a</tt> ''mostly;'' <tt>d\u00e1k\u1e63i\u1e47ena</tt> ''to the south;'' <tt>\u00fattare\u1e47a</tt> ''to the north;'' <tt>\u00e1ntare\u1e47a</tt> ''within;'' <tt>cir\u00e9\u1e47a</tt> ''long;'' \u2014 <tt>\u00e7\u00e1n\u0101is</tt> and <tt>\u00e7\u00e1nak\u0101is</tt> ''slowly;'' <tt>ucc\u0101\u00eds</tt> ''on high;'' <tt>n\u012bc\u0101is</tt> ''below;'' <tt>par\u0101c\u0101\u00eds</tt> ''afar;'' <tt>t\u00e1vi\u1e63\u012bbhis</tt> ''mightily;'' and so on.\n\nd.

Adverbially used instrumentals are (in the older language), oftener than any other case, distinguished from normal instrumentals by differences of form: thus, especially, by an irregular accent: as, <tt>am\u0101\u0301</tt> and <tt>d\u00edv\u0101</tt> (given above); perhaps <tt>g\u00fah\u0101</tt>; <tt>ap\u0101k\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>\u0101say\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>kuhay\u0101\u0301</tt> (?); <tt>naktay\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>svapnay\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>saman\u0101\u0301</tt>; <tt>adatray\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>\u1e5btay\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>ubhay\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>sumnay\u0101\u0301</tt> (?); <tt>daksin\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>madhy\u0101\u0301</tt>; <tt>n\u012bc\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>pr\u0101c\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>ucc\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>pa\u00e7c\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>tira\u00e7c\u0101\u0301</tt>; <tt>vas\u00e1nt\u0101</tt>; \u2014 in a few <tt>u</tt>-stems, by a <tt>y</tt> inserted before the ending, which is accented: thus, <tt>amuy\u0101\u0301</tt> (given above), <tt>\u0101\u00e7uy\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>s\u0101dhuy\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>raghuy\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>dh\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47uy\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>{{hws|anu\u1e63|anu\u1e63\u1e6dhuy\u0101\u0301}}</tt><noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"425044":{"pageid":425044,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/438","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><tt>{{hws|\u1e6dhuy\u0101\u0301|anu\u1e63\u1e6dhuy\u0101\u0301}}</tt>, <tt>mithuy\u0101\u0301</tt>; \u2014 and <tt>urviy\u0101\u0301</tt> (for <tt>urvy\u0101\u0301</tt>) and <tt>v\u00ed\u00e7vy\u0101</tt> (properly <tt>v\u00ed\u00e7vay\u0101</tt>) are more slightly irregular.\n\n1113.

Of noun-stems: as, <tt>\u0101s\u0101\u0301t</tt> ''near;'' <tt>\u0101r\u0101\u0301t</tt> ''afar;'' <tt>bal\u0101t</tt> ''forcibly;'' <tt>kut\u016bhal\u0101t</tt> ''emulously;'' <tt>sak\u0101\u00e7\u0101t</tt> ''on the part of''.\n\nc.

''most obviously;'' <tt>pratyant\u0101t</tt> (S.) ''to the end''.\n\nd. In a few instances, adverbially used ablatives likewise show a changed accent in the early language: thus, <tt>ap\u0101k\u0101\u0301t</tt> ''from afar;'' <tt>am\u0101\u0301t</tt> ''from near by;'' <tt>san\u0101\u0301t</tt> ''from of old'' (but instr. <tt>s\u00e1n\u0101</tt>); <tt>uttar\u0101\u0301t</tt> ''from the north;'' <tt>adhar\u0101\u0301t</tt> ''below''.\n\n1115. The genitive is almost never used adverbially.\n\na. In the older language occur <tt>akt\u00f3s</tt> ''by night'', and <tt>v\u00e1stos</tt> ''by day;'' later, <tt>cirasya</tt> ''long''.\n\n1116. The locative is sometimes used with adverbial value. Thus:\n\na. From noun and adjective stems: <tt>\u0101k\u00e9</tt> ''near;'' <tt>\u0101r\u00e9</tt> and <tt>d\u016br\u00e9</tt> ''afar;'' <tt>abhisvar\u00e9</tt> ''behind;'' <tt>astam\u012bk\u00e9</tt> ''at home;'' <tt>\u1e5bt\u00e9</tt> ''without'' (prep.); <tt>\u00e1gre</tt> ''in front;'' <tt>sth\u0101ne</tt> ''suitably;'' <tt>sapadi</tt> ''immediately;'' -<tt>arthe</tt> and -<tt>k\u1e5bte</tt> (common in composition) ''for the sake of;'' <tt>apar\u012b\u0301\u1e63u</tt> ''in after time;'' <tt>\u0101d\u0101u</tt> ''first;'' <tt>rahasi</tt> ''in secret''.\n\n1117.

Verbal Prefixes and kindred words. The verbal prefixes, described in the preceding chapter (1076 ff.), are properly adverbs, having a special office and mode of use in connection with verbal roots and their more immediate derivatives.\n\na. Their occasional looser connection with the verb has been noticed above (1084).

In composition with nouns, they (like other adverbial elements) not infrequently have an adjective value: see below, 1281 ff., 1305.\n\n1119. Several of the prefixes (as noticed above, 473\u20134) form comparative and superlative adjectives, by the suffixes <tt>tara</tt> and <tt>tama</tt>, or <tt>ra</tt> and <tt>ma</tt>: thus, <tt>\u00fattara</tt> and <tt>uttam\u00e1</tt>, <tt>\u00e1dhara</tt> and <tt>adham\u00e1</tt>, <tt>\u00e1para</tt> and <tt>apam\u00e1</tt>, <tt>\u00e1vara</tt> and <tt>avam\u00e1</tt>, <tt>\u00fapara</tt> and <tt>upam\u00e1</tt>, and <tt>pratham\u00e1</tt> is doubtless of the same character; also, <tt>\u00e1ntara</tt> and <tt>\u00e1ntama</tt>. And accusatives of such derivative adjectives (for the most part not otherwise found in use) have the value of comparatives, and rarely superlatives, to the prefixes themselves: thus, <tt>s\u00e1\u1e41ita\u1e41 cit sa\u1e41tar\u00e1\u1e41 s\u00e1\u1e41 \u00e7i\u00e7\u0101dhi</tt> (AV.)

''lead him forward still further toward advantage;'' <tt>\u00fad enam uttar\u00e1\u1e41 naya</tt> (AV.) ''lead him up still higher.''\n\na. Besides those instanced, are found also <tt>nitar\u00e1\u1e41</tt>, <tt>apatar\u00e1\u1e41</tt>, <tt>abhitar\u00e1\u1e41</tt>, <tt>avatar\u00e1\u1e41</tt>, <tt>par\u0101tar\u00e1\u1e41</tt>, <tt>parastar\u00e1\u1e41</tt>. In the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as and later (above, 1111 e), the feminine accusative is used instead: thus, <tt>atitar\u0101\u0301m</tt> and <tt>atitam\u0101m</tt>, <tt>abhitar\u0101\u0301m</tt>, <tt>anutam\u0101\u0301m</tt>, <tt>\u0101tam\u0101\u0301m</tt>, <tt>pratitar\u0101\u0301m</tt>, <tt>nitar\u0101\u0301m</tt>, <tt>uttar\u0101\u0301m</tt>, <tt>pratar\u0101\u0301m</tt> and <tt>pratam\u0101\u0301m</tt>, <tt>vitar\u0101\u0301m</tt>, <tt>sa\u1e41tar\u0101\u0301m</tt> (also RV., once).\n\n1120. Kindred in origin and character with the verbal prefixes, and used like them except in composition with verbs, are a few other adverbs: thus, <tt>av\u00e1s</tt> ''down;'' <tt>adh\u00e1s</tt> ''below'' (and <tt>adhastar\u0101\u0301m</tt>); <tt>par\u00e1s</tt> ''far off'' (and <tt>parastar\u0101\u0301m</tt>); <tt>pur\u0101\u0301</tt> ''before;'' <tt>antar\u0101\u0301</tt> (apparently, <tt>ant\u00e1r</tt>+<tt>\u0101\u0301</tt>) ''among, between;'' <tt>\u00e1nti</tt> ''near;'' <tt>up\u00e1ri</tt> ''above;'' and <tt>sah\u00e1</tt> (already mentioned, 1104b) ''along, with'', and <tt>s\u00e1c\u0101</tt> ''together, with'', may be noticed with them. <tt>Vin\u0101\u0301</tt> ''without'', and <tt>vi\u1e63u</tt>- ''apart'', appear to be related with <tt>v\u00ed</tt>.\n\n1121. Inseparable Prefixes. A small number of adverbial prefixes are found only in combination with, other elements. Thus:\n\na. The negative prefix <tt>a</tt> or <tt>an</tt> \u2014 <tt>an</tt> before vowels, <tt>a</tt> before consonants.\n\nb. It is combined especially with innumerable nouns and adjectives; much more rarely, with adverbs, as <tt>ak\u00fatra</tt> and <tt>\u00e1punar</tt> (RV.), <tt>\u00e1neva</tt> (AV.), <tt>\u00e1nadhas</tt> (TB.), <tt>akasm\u0101t</tt>, <tt>asak\u1e5bt</tt>; in rare cases, also with pronouns (as <tt>atad</tt>, <tt>aki\u1e41cit</tt>); and even, in the later language, now and then with verbs, as <tt>asp\u1e5bhayanti</tt> (BhP. \u00c7i\u00e7.) ''they do not desire'', <tt>alokayati</tt> (SD.) ''he does not view''. Now and then it is prefixed to itself: e. g. <tt>anak\u0101mam\u0101ra</tt>, <tt>anaviprayukta</tt>, <tt>anavadya</tt> (?).<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"425049":{"pageid":425049,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/440","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\nc. In a very few cases, the negative <tt>a</tt> appears to be made long: thus, <tt>\u0101\u0301sat</tt> ''non-existent'', <tt>\u0101\u0301deva</tt> ''godless'', <tt>\u0101\u0301r\u0101ti</tt> ''enemy'', <tt>\u0101\u00e7\u0101uca</tt> ''impurity'', <tt>\u0101\u0301tura</tt> ''ill'' (?).\n\nd. The independent negative adverbs, <tt>n\u00e1</tt> and <tt>m\u0101\u0301</tt>, are only in exceptional instances used in composition: see below, 1122e.\n\ne. The comitative prefix <tt>sa</tt>, used instead of the preposition <tt>s\u00e1m</tt>, and interchangeably with <tt>sah\u00e1</tt>, before nouns and adjectives.\n\nf. The prefix of dispraise <tt>dus</tt> ''ill, badly'' (identical with \u221a<tt>du\u1e63</tt>: 225 a).\n\ng. It is combined in the same manner as <tt>a</tt> or <tt>an</tt>. Of combinations with a verbal form, at least a single example appears to be quotable: <tt>du\u00e7caranti</tt> (R.) ''behave ill''.\n\nh. The corresponding laudatory prefix <tt>su</tt> ''well'' is in general so closely accordant in its use with the preceding that it is best mentioned here, though it occurs not rarely as an independent particle in the oldest language (in RV., more than two hundred times; in the peculiar parts of AV., only fourteen times), and even occasionally later.\n\ni. The particle <tt>su</tt> sometimes appears in B. and later before a verb-form, and considering its rapid loss of independent use in V., and the analogy of <tt>a</tt> and <tt>dus</tt> (above, b, g) it is probably at least in part to be regarded as in composition with the verb. The <tt>pada</tt>-text of AV. xix. 49. 10 reads <tt>su</tt>-<tt>\u00e1p\u0101yati</tt>, but its testimony is of little or no value. K. has <tt>na su vij\u00f1\u0101yete</tt> and <tt>na v\u0101i su vidu\u1e25</tt>, and KeU. has <tt>su veda</tt>; TB. has <tt>sus\u00e1mbodh\u00e1yati</tt> (?); MBh. and BhP. have <tt>s\u016bpatasthe</tt>; R. has <tt>su\u00e7akyante</tt>.\n\nj. The exclamatory and usually depreciative prefixed forms of the interrogative pronoun (506) are most analogous with the inseparable prefixes.\n\n1122. Miscellaneous Adverbs. Other words of adverbial character and office, not clearly referable to any of the classes hitherto treated, may be mentioned as follows:\n\na. Asseverative particles (in part, only in the older language): thus, <tt>an\u0304g\u00e1</tt>, <tt>h\u00e1nta</tt>, <tt>k\u00edla</tt>, <tt>kh\u00e1lu</tt>, <tt>t\u00fa</tt> (rare in older language), <tt>v\u0101\u00ed</tt>, <tt>v\u0101\u0301v\u00e1</tt> (in Br\u0101hma\u1e47a language only), <tt>hi</tt>, <tt>hin\u00e1</tt>, <tt>u</tt>, <tt>\u00e1ha</tt>, <tt>ha</tt>, <tt>gha</tt>, <tt>samaha</tt>, <tt>sma</tt>, <tt>bhala</tt>.\n\nb. Of these, <tt>h\u00e1nta</tt> is a word of assent and incitement; <tt>h\u00ed</tt> has won also an illative meaning, and accents the verb with which it stands in connection (595 e); <tt>sma</tt> sometimes appears to give a past meaning to a present tense (778 b); <tt>u</tt> is often combined with the final <tt>a</tt> of other particles: thus, <tt>\u00e1tho</tt>, <tt>n\u00f3</tt>, <tt>m\u00f3</tt>, <tt>ut\u00f3</tt>, <tt>\u00fapo</tt>, <tt>pr\u00f3</tt>; but also with that of verb-forms, as <tt>datt\u00f3</tt>, <tt>vidm\u00f3</tt>.

Some of the asseverative particles are much used in the later artificial poetry with a purely expletive value, as devices to help make out the metre (<tt>p\u0101dap\u016bra\u1e47a</tt> ''verse-fillers''); so especially <tt>ha</tt>, <tt>hi</tt>, <tt>tu</tt>, <tt>sma</tt>.\n\nc. Negative particles are: <tt>n\u00e1</tt>, signifying simple negation; <tt>m\u0101\u0301</tt>, signifying prohibition.\n\nd. As to the construction of the verb with <tt>m\u0101\u0301</tt>, see above, 579. In the Veda, <tt>n\u00fa</tt> (or <tt>n\u016b\u0301</tt>: 248 a) has also sometimes a negative meaning. For the Vedic <tt>n\u00e1</tt> of comparison, see below, g, h.\n\ne. In <tt>nah\u00ed</tt>, <tt>n\u00e1</tt> is combined with <tt>h\u00ed</tt>, both elements retaining their full meaning; also with <tt>\u00edd</tt> in <tt>n\u00e9d</tt> ''lest''. It is perhaps present in <tt>nan\u00fa</tt> and <tt>can\u00e1</tt>, but not in <tt>hin\u00e1</tt> (RV., once). In general, neither <tt>n\u00e1</tt> nor <tt>m\u0101\u0301</tt> is used in composition to make negative compounds, but, instead, the inseparable negative prefix <tt>a</tt> or <tt>an</tt> (1121 a): exceptions are the Vedic particles <tt>n\u00e1kis</tt> and <tt>m\u0101\u0301kis</tt>, <tt>n\u00e1k\u012bm</tt> and <tt>m\u0101\u0301k\u012bm</tt>; also <tt>naciram</tt> and <tt>m\u0101\u0301ciram</tt>, <tt>napu\u1e45saka</tt>, and, in the later language, a number of others.\n\nf. Interrogative particles are only those already given: <tt>k\u00e1d</tt>, <tt>kim</tt>, <tt>kuv\u00edd</tt>, <tt>svid</tt>, <tt>nan\u00fa</tt>, of which the last introduces an objection or expostulation.\n\ng. Of particles of comparison have been mentioned the toneless <tt>iva</tt>, and <tt>yath\u0101</tt> (also toneless when used in the same way). Of frequent occurrence in the oldest language is also <tt>n\u00e1</tt>, having (without loss of accent) the same position and value as the preceding.\n\nh. Examples of the <tt>n\u00e1</tt> of comparison are: <tt>\u1e5b\u1e63idv\u00ed\u1e63a \u00ed\u1e63u\u1e41 n\u00e1 s\u1e5bjata dv\u00ed\u1e63am</tt> (RV.)

This use is generally explained as being a modification or adaptation of the negative one: thus, ''[although, to be sure] not [precisely] a thirsty buffalo''; and so on.\n\ni. Of particles of place, besides those already mentioned, may be noticed <tt>kv\u00e0</tt> ''where?'' (in V., always to be read <tt>k\u00faa</tt>).\n\nj. Particles of time are: <tt>n\u00fa</tt> ''now'' (also <tt>n\u016b\u0301</tt>: <tt>n\u016bn\u00e1m</tt> was mentioned above, 1109 a), <tt>ady\u00e1</tt> and <tt>sady\u00e1s</tt> and <tt>sad\u00edvas</tt> (RV., once) ''today, at once'' (all held to contain the element <tt>div</tt> or <tt>dyu</tt>), <tt>hy\u00e1s</tt> ''yesterday'', <tt>\u00e7v\u00e1s</tt> ''tomorrow'', <tt>jy\u00f3k</tt> (also related with dyu) ''long;'' <tt>p\u00fanar</tt> ''again''.\n\nk. Of particles of manner, besides those already mentioned, may be noticed <tt>n\u0101\u0301n\u0101</tt> ''variously'' (for <tt>n\u0101n\u0101n\u00e1m</tt>, its derivative, see 1109 a); <tt>sasv\u00e1r</tt> (RV.) ''secretly''.\n\nl.

There is, as already stated, no proper class of prepositions (in the modern sense of that term), no body of words having for their prevailing office the \"government\" of nouns. But many of the adverbial words indicated above are used with nouns in a way which approximates them to the more fully developed prepositions of other languages.\n\na. If one and another of such words \u2014 as <tt>vin\u0101</tt>, <tt>\u1e5bte</tt> \u2014 occurs almost solely in prepositional use, this is merely fortuitous and unessential.\n\n1124. Words are thus used prepositionally along with all the noun-cases excepting the dative. But in general their office is directive only, determining more definitely, or strengthening, the proper case-use of the noun. Sometimes, however, the case-use is not easy to trace, and the noun then seems to be more immediately \"governed\" by the preposition \u2014 that is, to have its case-form more arbitrarily determined by its association with the latter. This is oftenest true of the accusative; and also of the genitive, which has, here as elsewhere (294 b), suffered an extension of its normal sphere of use.\n\n1125. a. The adverbs by derivative form (1097 ff.) have least of a prepositional value (exceptions are especially a few made with the suffix <tt>tas</tt>: 1098).\n\nb. Most of the verbal prefixes (exceptions are <tt>ud</tt>, <tt>ni</tt>, <tt>par\u0101</tt>, <tt>pra</tt>; and <tt>ava</tt> and <tt>vi</tt> are almost such) have their prepositional or quasi-prepositional uses with cases; but much more widely in the older time than in the later: in the classical language the usage is mainly restricted to <tt>prati</tt>, <tt>anu</tt>, and <tt>\u0101</tt>.\n\nc. Most of the directive words akin with the more proper prefixes are used prepositionally: some of them \u2014 as <tt>saha</tt>, <tt>vin\u0101</tt>, <tt>upari</tt>, <tt>antar\u0101</tt>, <tt>pur\u0101</tt> \u2014 freely, earlier and later.\n\nd. The case-forms used adverbially are in many instances used prepositionally also: oftenest, as was to be expected, with the genitive; but frequently, and from an early time, with the accusative; more rarely with other cases.\n\ne. We will take up now the cases for a brief exposition, beginning with those that are least freely used.\n\n1126. The Locative. This case is least of all used with words that can claim the name of preposition. Of directives, <tt>ant\u00e1r</tt> and its later derivative <tt>antar\u0101\u0301</tt>, meaning ''within, in'', are oftenest added to it, and in the classical language as well as earlier. Of frequent Vedic use with it are <tt>\u0101\u0301</tt> and <tt>\u00e1dhi</tt>: thus, <tt>m\u00e1rtye\u1e63v \u0101\u0301</tt> ''among mortals;'' <tt>p\u1e5bthivy\u0101\u0301m \u00e1dhy \u00f3\u1e63adh\u012b\u1e25</tt> ''the plants upon the earth;'' <tt>t\u00e9jo m\u00e1yi dh\u0101ray\u0101\u0301 \u2019dhi</tt> (AV.) ''establish glory''<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"425052":{"pageid":425052,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/443","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>''in me;'' \u2014 <tt>\u00e1pi</tt> and <tt>\u00fapa</tt> are much rarer: thus, <tt>y\u0101\u0301 ap\u0101\u0301m \u00e1pi vrat\u00e9</tt> [<tt>s\u00e1nti</tt>] (RV.)

The Instrumental. The directives used with this case are almost only those which contain the associative pronominal root <tt>sa</tt>: as <tt>sah\u00e1</tt> (most frequent), <tt>s\u0101k\u00e1m</tt>, <tt>s\u0101rdh\u00e1m</tt>, <tt>sam\u00e1m</tt>, <tt>sam\u00e1y\u0101</tt>, <tt>sar\u00e1tham</tt>; and, in the Veda, the prefix <tt>s\u00e1m</tt>: as, <tt>te sumat\u00edbhi\u1e25 s\u00e1m p\u00e1tn\u012bbhir n\u00e1 v\u1e5b\u0301\u1e63a\u1e47o nas\u012bmahi</tt> (RV.) ''may we be united with thy favors as men with their spouses''. By substitution of the instrumental for the ablative of separation (283 a), <tt>vin\u0101</tt> ''without'' (not Vedic) takes sometimes the instrumental; and so, in the Veda, <tt>av\u00e1s</tt> ''down'' and <tt>par\u00e1s</tt> ''beyond'', with which the ablative is also, and much more normally, construed. And <tt>\u00e1dhi</tt>, in RV., is used with the instrumental <tt>sn\u00fan\u0101</tt> and <tt>sn\u00fabhis</tt>, where the locative would be expected.\n\n1128. The Ablative. In the prepositional constructions of the ablative (as was pointed out and partly illustrated above, 293), the ablative value of the case, and the merely directive value of the added particle, are for the most part clearly to be traced. Many of the verbal prefixes are more or less frequently joined in the older language with this case: oftenest, <tt>\u00e1dhi</tt> and <tt>p\u00e1ri</tt>; more sporadically, <tt>\u00e1nu</tt>, <tt>\u00e1pa</tt>, <tt>\u00e1va</tt>, <tt>pr\u00e1ti</tt>, and the separatives <tt>n\u00eds</tt> and <tt>v\u00ed</tt>. The change of meaning of the ablative with <tt>\u0101\u0301</tt> ''hither'', by which it comes to fill the office of its opposite, the accusative, was sufficiently explained above (293 c). Of directive words akin with the prefixes, many \u2014 as <tt>bah\u00eds</tt>, <tt>pur\u00e1s</tt>, <tt>av\u00e1s</tt>, <tt>adh\u00e1s</tt>, <tt>par\u00e1s</tt>, <tt>pur\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>vin\u0101</tt>, and <tt>tir\u00e1s</tt> ''out of knowledge of'' \u2014 accompany this case by a perfectly regular construction. Also the case-forms <tt>arv\u0101\u0301k</tt>, <tt>pr\u0101\u0301k</tt>, <tt>pa\u00e7c\u0101\u0301t</tt>, <tt>\u016brdhv\u00e1m</tt>, <tt>p\u016b\u0301rvam</tt>, <tt>p\u00e1ram</tt>, and <tt>\u1e5bt\u00e9</tt> ''without'', of which the natural construction with an ablative is predominant earlier.\n\n1129. The Accusative. Many of the verbal prefixes and related words take an accompanying accusative. Most naturally (since the accusative is essentially the ''to''-case), those that express a motion or action toward anything: as <tt>abh\u00ed</tt>, <tt>pr\u00e1ti</tt>, <tt>\u00e1nu</tt>, <tt>\u00fapa</tt>, <tt>\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>\u00e1ti</tt> and <tt>\u00e1dhi</tt> in the sense of ''over on to'', or ''across, beyond'', <tt>tir\u00e1s</tt> ''through'', <tt>ant\u00e1r</tt> and <tt>antar\u0101\u0301</tt> when meaning ''between'', <tt>p\u00e1ri</tt> ''around''. Examples are: <tt>y\u0101\u0301\u1e25 prad\u00ed\u00e7o abh\u00ed s\u016b\u0301ryo vic\u00e1\u1e63\u1e6de</tt> (AV.)

Also <tt>abh\u00edtas</tt> and <tt>par\u00edtas</tt>, which have a like value with the simple <tt>abh\u00ed</tt> and <tt>p\u00e1ri</tt>;<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"425053":{"pageid":425053,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/444","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>and <tt>up\u00e1ri</tt> ''above'' (oftener with genitive). Less accordant with ordinary accusative constructions is the use of this case with <tt>adhas</tt>, <tt>paras</tt>, <tt>paras</tt>, <tt>vin\u0101</tt>, beside other cases which seem more suited to the meaning of those particles. And the same may be said of most of the adverbial case-forms with which the accusative is used. Thus, a number of instrumental of situation or direction: as <tt>y\u00e9 \u2018vare\u1e47\u0101 \u201ddity\u00e1m y\u00e9 p\u00e1re\u1e47\u0101 \u201ddity\u00e1m</tt> (TB.)

''to the south of the sacrificial hearth;'' <tt>dak\u1e63i\u1e47ena v\u1e5bk\u1e63av\u0101\u1e6dik\u0101m</tt> (\u00c7.) ''to the right of the orchard;'' <tt>nika\u1e63\u0101\u0301 yamun\u0101m</tt> (Har.) ''near the Yamun\u0101''. Similarly, \u016brdhvam and p\u016brvam have an accusative object as well as an ablative; and the same is true later of <tt>\u1e5bte</tt>. <tt>Abhimukham</tt> ''toward'' has a more natural right to construction with this case.\n\n1130. The Genitive. The words which are accompanied by the genitive are mostly case-forms of nouns, or of adjectives used substantively, retaining enough of the noun-character to take this case as their natural adjunct.

They are also by no means frequent in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, except in \u00c7B. (where they abound: chiefly, perhaps, for the reason that this work uses in considerable part the perfect instead of the imperfect as its narrative tense).\n\n1046. Aorist.

In a few cases, where the root has assumed a peculiar form before the causative sign \u2014 as by the addition of a <tt>p</tt> or <tt>\u1e63</tt> (above, 1042 i ff.) \u2014 the reduplicated aorist is made from this form instead of from the simple root: thus, <tt>ati\u1e63\u1e6dhipam</tt> from <tt>sth\u0101p</tt> (stem <tt>sth\u0101paya</tt> for \u221a<tt>sth\u0101</tt>.

But a few sporadic forms of an <tt>i\u1e63</tt>-aorist from causative conjugation-stems are met with: thus, <tt>dhvanay\u012bt</tt> (RV.; TS. has instead the wholly anomalous <tt>dhvanayit</tt>), <tt>vyathay\u012bs</tt> and <tt>\u0101ilay\u012bt</tt> (AV.), <tt>py\u0101yayia\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101s</tt> and <tt>av\u0101dayi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101s</tt> (KBU.), in the older language (RV. has also <tt>\u016bnay\u012bs</tt> from a <tt>denominative</tt> stem); in the later, <tt>ahl\u0101dayi\u1e63ata</tt> (DKC.), and probably <tt>agh\u0101tayith\u0101s</tt> (MBh.; for -<tt>i\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101s</tt>: cf. 904 d). The passive 3d sing, <tt>aropi</tt>, from the causative <tt>ropaya</tt>, has a late occurrence (\u00c7atr.).\n\n1049. A precative is of course allowed by the grammarians to be made for the causative conjugation: in the middle, from the causative stem with the auxiliary <tt>i</tt> substituted for its final <tt>a</tt>; in the active, from the form of the root as strengthened in the causative stem, but without the causative sign: thus,\n\n{|class=prettytable\n| \u0927\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u092e\u094d <tt>dh\u0101ry\u0101sam</tt> etc. || \u0927\u093e\u0930\u092f\u093f\u0937\u0940\u092f <tt>dh\u0101rayi\u1e63\u012bya</tt> etc.\n|}\n\nThis formation is to be regarded as purely fictitious.\n\n1050.

It has been mentioned above that RV. and AV. contain only two \nexamples each of the <tt>s</tt>-future, and none of the periphrastic. The former begin to appear in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as more numerously, but still sparingly, with participles, and conditional (only <tt>adh\u0101rayi\u1e63yat</tt> \u00c7B.; <tt>al\u0101payi\u1e63yath\u0101s</tt> ChU.); of the latter, \u00c7B. affords two instances (<tt>p\u0101rayit\u0101\u0301smi</tt> and <tt>janayit\u0101\u0301si</tt>).

These are made in two different ways: either 1. from the full causative stem (in the same manner as the futures, just described); or 2. from the causatively strengthened root-form (with loss of the causative-sign).\n\na. To the latter class belong the passive participle, as <tt>dh\u0101rita</tt>; the gerundive and gerund in <tt>ya</tt>, as <tt>dh\u0101rya</tt>, -<tt>dh\u0101rya</tt>; and the gerund in <tt>am</tt>, as <tt>dh\u0101ram</tt>; also, in the older language, the root-infinitive, as -<tt>dh\u0101ram</tt> etc. (970 a). To the former class belong the infinitive and the gerund in <tt>tv\u0101</tt>, as <tt>dh\u0101rayitum</tt>, <tt>dh\u0101rayitv\u0101</tt>, and the gerundive in <tt>tavya</tt>, as <tt>dh\u0101rayitavya</tt> (also, in the older language, the infinitives in <tt>tav\u0101i</tt> and <tt>dhy\u0101i</tt>, as <tt>j\u00e1nayitav\u0101\u00ed</tt>, <tt>\u012bray\u00e1dhy\u0101i</tt>, etc.). The auxiliary <tt>i</tt> is taken in every formation which ever admits that vowel.\n\nb. Examples of the passive participle are <tt>\u012brit\u00e1</tt>, <tt>v\u0101sita</tt>, <tt>\u00e7r\u0101vit\u00e1</tt>. But from the quasi-root <tt>j\u00f1ap</tt> (1042 j) is made <tt>j\u00f1apta</tt>, without union-vowel.\n\nc. Examples of the infinitive and gerund in <tt>tv\u0101</tt> are <tt>j\u00f3\u1e63ayitum</tt>, <tt>dh\u0101\u0301rayitum</tt>; <tt>kalpayitv\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>arpayitv\u0101\u0301</tt>. But in the epics, and even later, infinitives are occasionally made with loss of the causative-sign: e. g. <tt>\u00e7e\u1e63itum</tt>, <tt>bh\u0101vitum</tt>, <tt>dh\u0101ritum</tt>, <tt>mocitum</tt>.\n\nd.

But stems showing in the root-syllable no difference from the root retain <tt>ay</tt> of the causative-sign in the gerund, to distinguish it from that belonging to the primary conjugation: e. g. -<tt>kram\u00e1yya</tt>, -<tt>gam\u00e1yya</tt>, -<tt>jan\u00e1yya</tt>, -<tt>jval\u00e1yya</tt>, -<tt>kalayya</tt>, -<tt>\u00e7amayya</tt>, -<tt>racayya</tt>, -<tt>\u0101payya</tt>.\n\ne.
