It is decidedly less extended beyond the limits of a present-system than any other of the derivative conjugations. \n\na. The intensive conjugation signifies the repetition or the intensification of the action expressed by the primary conjugation of a root. \n\n1001. According to the grammarians, the intensive conjugation may be formed from nearly all the roots in the language \u2014 the exceptions being roots of more than one syllable, those conjugated only causatively (below, 1056), and in general those beginning with a vowel. \n\na. In fact, however, intensives in the later language are very rare, so rare that it is hard to tell precisely what value is to be given to the rules of the native grammar respecting them. Nor are they at all common earlier, except (comparatively) in the RV., which contains about six sevenths of the whole number (rather over a hundred) quotable from Veda and Br\u0101hma\u1e47a and S\u016btra-texts; AV. has less than half as many as RV., and many of them in RV. passages; from the later language are quotable about twenty of these, and about forty more, but for the most part only in an occurrence or two. \n\nb. Hence, in the description to be given below, the actual aspect of the formation, as exhibited in the older language, will be had primarily and especially in view; and the examples will be of forms found there in use. \n\n1002. The strong intensive reduplication is made in three different ways: \n\nI. a. The reduplicating syllable is, as elsewhere, composed of a single consonant with following vowel, and, so far as the consonant is concerned, follows the rules for present and perfect reduplication (590); but the vowel is a heavy one, radical <tt>a</tt> and <tt>\u1e5b</tt> (or <tt>ar</tt>) being reduplicated with <tt>\u0101</tt>, an <tt>i</tt>-vowel by <tt>e</tt>, and an <tt>u</tt>-vowel by <tt>o</tt>. \n\nExamples are: <tt>v\u0101vad</tt>, <tt>b\u0101badh</tt>, <tt>\u00e7\u0101\u00e7vas</tt>, <tt>r\u0101randh</tt>; <tt>d\u0101d\u1e5b</tt>, <tt>d\u0101dh\u1e5b</tt>; <tt>cekit</tt>, <tt>tetij</tt>, <tt>nen\u012b</tt>, <tt>vevl\u012b</tt>; <tt>\u00e7o\u00e7uc</tt>, <tt>popruth</tt>, <tt>co\u1e63ku</tt>, <tt>joh\u016b</tt>. \n\nII. b. The reduplicating syllable has a final consonant, taken from the end of the root.

We have seen, indeed, that the tense-systems are also for the most part made from derivative-stems; and even that, in some cases, such stems assume the appearance and value of roots, and are made the basis of a complete conjugational system. Nor is there any distinct division-line to be drawn between tense-systems and derivative conjugations; the latter are present-systems which have been expanded into conjugations by the addition of other tenses, and of participles, infinitives, and so on. In the earliest language, their forms outside of the present-system are still quite rare, hardly more than sporadic; and even later they are \u2014 with the exception of one or two formations which attain a comparative frequency \u2014 much less common than the corresponding forms of primary conjugation. \n\n997. The secondary conjugations are: I. Passive; II. Intensive; III. Desiderative; IV. Causative; V. Denominative. \n\na. The passive is classed here as a secondary conjugation because of its analogy with the others in respect to specific value, and freedom of formation, although it does not, like them, make its forms outside the present system from its present-stem. \n\n<center>I.

Possessives also in <tt>in</tt> made from passive participles are sometimes found used in an analogous manner, nearly as perfect active participles: e. g. <tt>i\u1e63\u1e6d\u00edn</tt> ''having sacrificed'', <tt>vijitino manyam\u0101n\u0101\u1e25</tt> (AB.) ''thinking themselves to have conquered''. \n\n<center>Future Passive Participles: Gerundives.</center>\n\n961. Certain derivative adjectives (for the most part more or less clearly secondary derivatives) have acquired in the language a value as qualifying something which is to, or which ought to, suffer the action expressed by the root from which they come; and they are allowed to be made from every verb. Hence they are, like more proper participles, sometimes treated as a part of the general verbal system, and called future passive participles, or gerundives (like the Latin forms in ''ndus'', to which they correspond in meaning). \n\n962. The suffixes by which such gerundives are regularly and ordinarily made are three: namely \u092f <tt>ya</tt>, \u0924\u0935\u094d\u092f <tt>tavya</tt>, and \u0905\u0928\u0940\u092f <tt>an\u012bya</tt>. \n\na. Derivatives in <tt>ya</tt> having this value are made in all periods of the language, from the earliest down; the other two are of more modern origin, being entirely wanting in the oldest Veda (RV.), and hardly known in the later. Other derivatives of a similar character, which afterward disappear from use, are found in the Veda (966). \n\n963. The suffix <tt>ya</tt> in its gerundive use has nothing to distinguish it from the same suffix as employed to make adjectives and nouns of other character (see below, 1213). And it exhibits also the same variety in the treatment of the root. \n\na. The original value of the suffix is <tt>ia</tt>, and as such it has to be read in the very great majority of its Vedic occurrences. Hence the conversion of <tt>e</tt> and <tt>o</tt> to <tt>ay</tt> and <tt>av</tt> before it (see below). \n\nb. Thus: 1. Final <tt>\u0101</tt> becomes <tt>e</tt> before the suffix: <tt>d\u00e9ya, dhyeya, khy\u00e9ya, m\u00e9ya</tt> (perhaps <tt>d\u0101\u0301-ia</tt> etc., with euphonic <tt>y</tt> interposed); but RV. has once <tt>-j\u00f1\u0101ya</tt>. \u2014 2. The other vowels either remain unchanged, or have the <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt> or the <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt> strengthening; and <tt>e</tt> usually and <tt>o</tt> always are treated before the <tt>ya</tt> as they would be before a vowel: thus, <tt>-k\u1e63ayya, j\u00e1yya, bh\u00e1yya, l\u0101yya; n\u00e1vya, bh\u00e1vya, h\u00e1vya, bh\u0101vy\u00e1; v\u0101\u0301rya</tt>: and, in the later language, <tt>n\u012bya, jeya, dh\u016bya</tt> (such cases are wanting earlier).

It remains to describe certain others, which, being made directly from the root itself, belong to the verbal system as a whole, and not to any particular part of it. \n\nb. The infinitive (with a few sporadic exceptions in the older language) also comes in all cases from the root directly, and not from any of the derived tense-stems. \n\nc. The same is true of the so-called gerunds, or indeclinable participles.  \n\n<center>Passive Participle in <tt>t\u00e1</tt> or <tt>n\u00e1</tt>.</center> \n\n952. By accented suffix \u0924 <tt>t\u00e1</tt> \u2014 or, in a comparatively small number of verbs, \u0928 <tt>n\u00e1</tt> \u2014 is formed a verbal adjective which, when coming from transitive verbs, qualifies anything as having endured the action expressed by the verb: thus, \u0926\u0924\u094d\u0924 <tt>datt\u00e1</tt> ''given''; \u0909\u0915\u094d\u0924 <tt>ukt\u00e1</tt> ''spoken''. Hence it is usually called the passive participle; or, to distinguish it from the participle belonging to the passive present-system (771), the past passive participle. \n\na. When made from an intransitive or neuter verb, the same participle, as in other languages, has no passive but only an indefinite past sense: thus, \u0917\u0924 <tt>gat\u00e1</tt> ''gone''; \u092d\u0942\u0924 <tt>bh\u016bt\u00e1</tt> ''been''; \u092a\u0924\u093f\u0924 <tt>patit\u00e1</tt> ''fallen''. \n\n953. In general, this participle is made by adding \u0924 <tt>t\u00e1</tt>  to the bare verbal root, with observation of the ordinary rules of euphonic combination. \n\na. Some roots, however, require the prefixion of the auxiliary vowel <tt>i</tt> to the suffix.

The middle optative of this aorist also forms a part of the accepted \"precative\" of the later language (923, 925 b). It is very rare at all periods, being made in RV. from only five roots, and in AV. from two of the same and from three additional ones (six of the eight have other <tt>i\u1e63</tt>-forms); and the remaining texts add, so far as noticed, only four other roots. All the forms found to occur are as follows: <tt>jani\u1e63\u012bya, indhi\u1e63\u012bya, edhi\u1e63\u012by\u00e1, ruci\u1e63\u012bya and roci\u1e63\u012bya, gmi\u1e63\u012bya; modi\u1e63\u012b\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101s; jani\u1e63\u012b\u1e63\u1e6da; vani\u1e63\u012b\u1e63\u1e6da; sahi\u1e63\u012bvahi; idhi\u1e63\u012bmahi, edhi\u1e63\u012bm\u00e1hi, jani\u1e63\u012bmahi, t\u0101ri\u1e63\u012bmahi, mandi\u1e63\u012bmahi, vandi\u1e63\u012bm\u00e1hi, vardhi\u1e63\u012bm\u00e1hi, sahi\u1e63\u012bmahi</tt> and <tt>s\u0101hi\u1e63\u012bm\u00e1hi</tt>. The accent is on the ending, and this would lead us to expect a weak form of root throughout; but the usage in this respect appears to be various, and the cases are too few to allow of setting up any rule.

Other forms occur only in 2d du. and 2d pl., and are accordingly such as might also be subjunctives used imperatively (which is further made probable for two of them by their accentuation on the root-syllable): they are <tt>krami\u1e63\u1e6dam, gami\u1e63\u1e6dam, cani\u1e63\u1e6d\u00e1m, cayi\u1e63\u1e6dam</tt> (against <tt>ac\u0101yi\u1e63am</tt>), <tt>t\u0101\u0301ri\u1e63\u1e6dam, yodhi\u1e63\u1e6dam, vadhi\u1e63\u1e6dam, \u00e7nathi\u1e63\u1e6dam; r\u00e1\u1e47i\u1e63\u1e6dana</tt> (against <tt>ar\u0101\u1e47i\u1e63us</tt>), <tt>\u00e7nathi\u1e63\u1e6dana</tt>. \n\n909.

The marked difference in the strength of radical vowel in the active, however, stands in the way of the successful application of such an explanation to the active forms.\n\n920. a.

Forms without augment (no true subjunctives occur) are, in the active: <tt>d\u1e5bk\u1e63am, m\u1e5bk\u1e63am; duk\u1e63as, ruk\u1e63as, m\u1e5bk\u1e63as; dvik\u1e63at; m\u1e5bk\u1e63ata; dhuk\u1e63\u00e1n</tt> and <tt>duk\u1e63\u00e1n</tt>; \u2014 in the middle, <tt>dvik\u1e63ata, duk\u1e63ata</tt> and <tt>dh\u00fak\u1e63ata, dhuk\u1e63\u00e1nta</tt>.\n\nc.

The few accented forms without augment which occur have the tone on the tense-sign <tt>s\u00e1</tt>, in analogy with the <tt>a</tt>-aorist (2) and the imperfect of the <tt>\u00e1</tt>-class: a single exception is <tt>dh\u00fak\u1e63ata</tt>, which probably needs emendation to <tt>dhuk\u1e63\u00e1ta</tt>.\n\nf. The aspiration of initial <tt>d</tt> and <tt>g</tt>, after loss of the aspirated quality of the root-final (155), is seen in forms from the roots <tt>duh</tt> and <tt>guh</tt>, but not from <tt>druh</tt> (only a single case, AB.); RV., however, has also <tt>aduk\u1e63at</tt> and <tt>duk\u1e63as, duk\u1e63\u00e1n, duk\u1e63ata</tt>.\n\n<center>Precative.</center>\n\n921. As the so-called precative is allowed by the grammarians to be made in the later language from every root, and in an independent way, without reference to the mode of formation of the aorist from the same root, it is desirable to put together here a brief statement of the rules given for it.\n\n922. The precative active is made by adding the active precative endings (above, 568) directly to the root. But:\n\na. Of final root-vowels (as before the passive-sign <tt>y\u00e1</tt>: 770), <tt>i</tt> and <tt>u</tt> are lengthened; <tt>\u1e5b</tt> is usually changed to <tt>ri</tt>, but to <tt>\u012br</tt> and <tt>\u016br</tt> in those roots which elsewhere show <tt>ir</tt>- and <tt>ur</tt>- forms (so-called <tt>\u1e5d</tt>-roots: 242), and to <tt>ar</tt> in <tt>\u1e5b</tt> and <tt>sm\u1e5b</tt>; <tt>\u0101</tt> is changed to <tt>e</tt> in the roots <tt>d\u0101, dh\u0101, sth\u0101, p\u0101</tt> ''drink'', <tt>g\u0101</tt> ''sing'', and a few others, in part optionally.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"415368":{"pageid":415368,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/355","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\nb. The root in general assumes its weakest form: a penultimate nasal is lost, as in <tt>badhy\u0101sam</tt> from \u221a<tt>bandh</tt>; the roots which are abbreviated in the weak persons of the perfect (794) have the same abbreviation here, as in <tt>ucy\u0101sam, ijy\u0101sam, vidhy\u0101sam, supy\u0101sam, g\u1e5bhy\u0101sam</tt>; \u221a<tt>\u00e7\u0101s</tt> forms <tt>\u00e7i\u1e63y\u0101sam</tt> (compare 639, 854 c): and so on.\n\nc. It has been pointed out above (837) that the active precative is an optative of the root-aorist, with a problematic insertion of a sibilant between mode-sign and ending.\n\n923. a. The precative middle is made by adding the middle precative endings (above, 568) to the root increased by \u0938\u094d <tt>s</tt> or \u0907\u0937\u094d <tt>i\u1e63</tt> \u2014 that is, to the tense-stem of an <tt>s</tt>-aorist or of an <tt>i\u1e63</tt>-aorist (but without augment).\n\nb. The root is strengthened according to the rules that apply in forming the middle-stem of the <tt>s</tt> and of the <tt>i\u1e63</tt>-aorists respectively: in general, namely, a final vowel is gunated in both formations; but a medial vowel, only before \u0907\u0937\u094d <tt>i\u1e63</tt>.\n\nc. As was pointed out above (567) the middle precative is really the optative of certain aorists, with the insertion of a sibilant between mode-sign and ending only (so far as authenticated by use) in the 2d and 3d singular. In the older language, such forms are oftenest made from the <tt>s</tt>-aorist (895) and the <tt>i\u1e63</tt>-aorist (907); but also from the root-aorist (837 b), the <tt>a</tt>-aorist (850 a), the reduplicated aorist (870), and the <tt>si\u1e63</tt>-aorist (914 b); and even from the perfect (812 b).\n\n924. As example of inflection, we may take the root \u092d\u0942 <tt>bh\u016b</tt> ''be'', which is said (no middle aorist or precative from it is quotable) to form its middle on the <tt>i\u1e63</tt>-stem.

The forms given by the grammarians as 2d and 3d dual are of very questionable value, as regards the place assigned to the sibilant. Those persons, and the 2d pl., have never been met with in use. For the question respecting the ending of the 2d pl., as <tt>dhvam</tt> or <tt>\u1e0dhvam</tt>, see 226 c.\n\n925. a. The precative active is a form of very rare occurrence in the classical language. In each of the texts already more than once referred to (Manu, Nala, Bhagavad-G\u012bt\u0101, \u00c7akuntal\u0101, Hitopade\u00e7a) it occurs once and no more, and not half-a-dozen forms have been found quotable from the epics. As to its value, see 573 c.\n\nb. The precative middle is virtually unknown in the whole later literature, not a single occurrence of it having been brought to light. The BhP. has once <tt>r\u012bri\u1e63\u012b\u1e63\u1e6da</tt>, which is also a RV. form, belonging probably to the reduplicated aorist: see 870.\n\n<center>Uses of the Aorist.</center>\n\n926. The uses of the aorist mode-forms (as has been already pointed out: 582) appear to accord with those of the mode-forms of the present-system. The predilection of the earlier language, continued sparingly in the later, for the augmentless forms in prohibitive expression after <tt>m\u0101\u0301</tt> was sufficiently stated and illustrated above (579).\n\na. The tense-value of the aorist indicative has also been more than once referred to, and calls only for somewhat more of detail and for illustration here.\n\n927.

Thus, the RV. has only seventeen occurrences of personal forms, from nine different roots (with participles from six additional roots); the AV. has fifty occurrences, from twenty-five roots (with participles from seven more); but the TS. has occurrences (personal forms and participles together) from over sixty roots; and forms from more than a hundred and fifty roots are quotable from the older texts.\n\n<center>Modes of the <tt>s</tt>-future.</center>\n\n938.

Thus, from the verbs instanced above, \u0926\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d <tt>d\u0101sy\u00e1nt</tt> and \u0926\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092f\u092e\u093e\u0928 <tt>d\u0101sy\u00e1m\u0101na</tt>, \u0915\u0930\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d <tt>kari\u1e63y\u00e1nt</tt> and \u0915\u0930\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092f\u092e\u093e\u0923 <tt>kari\u1e63y\u00e1m\u0101\u1e47a</tt>.\n\na.

This preterit is called the conditional.\n\na. It stands related to the future, in form and meaning, as the French conditional ''aurais'' to the future ''aurai'', or as the English ''would have'' to ''will have'' \u2014 nearly as the German ''w\u00fcrde haben'' to ''werde haben''.\n\nb.

In the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as it is hardly more common \u2014 except in \u00c7B., where it is met with more than fifty times. Nor does it, like the future, become more frequent later: not an example occurs in Nala, Bhagavad-G\u012bt\u0101, or Hitopade\u00e7a; only one in Manu; and two in \u00c7akuntal\u0101.

This formation contains only a single indicative active tense (or also middle: see 947), without modes, or participle, or preterit.\n\nb. It consists in a derivative ''nomen agentis'', having the value of a future active participle, and used, either with or without an accompanying auxiliary, in the office of a verbal tense with future meaning. \n\n943. The noun is formed by the suffix \u0924\u0943 <tt>t\u1e5b</tt> (or \u0924\u0930\u094d <tt>tar</tt>); and this (as in its other than verbal uses: see 1182) is added to the root either directly or with a preceding auxiliary vowel \u0907 <tt>i</tt>, the root itself being strengthened by <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>, but the accent resting on the suffix: thus, \u0926\u093e\u0924\u0943 <tt>d\u0101t\u1e5b\u0301</tt> from \u221a\u0926\u093e <tt>d\u0101</tt> ''give''; \u0915\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0943 <tt>kart\u1e5b\u0301</tt> from \u221a\u0915\u0943 <tt>k\u1e5b</tt> ''make''; \u092d\u0935\u093f\u0924\u0943 <tt>bhavit\u1e5b\u0301</tt> from \u221a\u092d\u0942 <tt>bh\u016b</tt> ''be''.\n\na.

Occasionally, in the epics and later (almost never in the older language), the norm of the tense as given above is in various respects departed from: thus, by use of the auxiliary in the 3d person also; by its omission in the 1st or 2d person; by inversion of the order of noun and auxiliary; by interposition of other words between them; by use of a dual or plural nom. with the auxiliary; and by use of a feminine form of the noun. Examples are: <tt>vakt\u0101 \u2019sti</tt> (MBh.) ''he will speak''; <tt>nihant\u0101</tt> (MBh.) ''I shall'' or ''thou wilt strike down'', <tt>yoddh\u0101 \u2019ham</tt> (R.)

An optative of the auxiliary appears to be once used, in <tt>yoddh\u0101 sy\u0101m</tt> ''I would fight'' (R. i. 22. 25 Peterson; but the Bombay edition reads <tt>yoddhu\u1e41 y\u0101sy\u0101mi</tt>).\n\n945.

''then I shall be out of danger'' (where <tt>bhavi\u1e63y\u0101mi</tt>, if used, would be accentless). Whether in a dependent clause the auxiliary verb would take an accent (595), and whether, if so, at the expense of the accent of the noun (as in the case of a preposition compounded with a verb-form: 1083b), we are without the means of determining. \n\n940. In the Veda, the ''nomina agentis'' in <tt>t\u1e5b</tt> or <tt>tar</tt>, like various other derivative nouns (271), but with especial frequency, are used in participial construction, governing the accusative if they come from roots whose verbal forms do so (1182). Often, also, they are used predicatively, with or without accompanying copula; yet without any implication of time; they are not the beginnings, but only the forerunners, of a new tense-formation. Generally, when they have a participial value, the root-syllable (or a prefix preceding it) has the accent. The tense-use begins, but rather sparingly, in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as (from which about thirty forms are quotable); and it grows more common later, though the periphrastic future is nowhere nearly so frequent as the <tt>s</tt>-future (it is quotable later from about thirty additional roots). \n\n947. a. A few isolated attempts are made in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as to form by analogy middle persons to this future, with endings corresponding after the usual fashion to those of the active persons. Thus, TS. has once <tt>prayokt\u0101\u0301se</tt> ''I will apply'' (standing related to <tt>prayokt\u0101smi</tt> as, for example, <tt>\u00e7\u0101se</tt> to <tt>\u00e7\u0101smi</tt>); \u00c7B. has <tt>\u00e7ayit\u0101\u0301se</tt> ''thou shalt lie'' (similarly related to <tt>\u00e7ayit\u0101si</tt>); and TB. has <tt>ya\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u0301smahe</tt> ''we will make offering''. But in TA. is found (i. 11) <tt>ya\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u0301he</tt> as 1st sing., showing a phonetic correspondence of a problematic character, not elsewhere met with in the language. \n\nb. On the basis of such tentative formations as these, the native grammarians set up a complete middle inflection for the periphrastic future, as follows: \n\n<div align=\"center\">\n{| class=\"prettytable\" \n! ||s.|| d.|| p.\n|-\n|1|| <tt>d\u0101t\u0101\u0301he</tt>|| <tt>d\u0101t\u0101\u0301svahe</tt>|| <tt>d\u0101t\u0101\u0301smahe</tt> \n|-\n|2|| <tt>d\u0101t\u0101\u0301se</tt>|| <tt>d\u0101t\u0101\u0301s\u0101the</tt> ||<tt>d\u0101t\u0101\u0301dhve</tt> \n|-\n|3|| <tt>d\u0101t\u0101\u0301</tt>|| <tt>d\u0101t\u0101\u0301rau</tt>|| <tt>d\u0101t\u0101\u0301ras</tt> \n|}</div >\n\nc. Only a single example of such a middle has been brought to light in the later language, namely (the causative) <tt>dar\u00e7ayit\u0101he</tt> (N\u0101i\u1e63.). \n\n<center>Uses of the Futures and Conditional.</center> \n\n948. As the <tt>s</tt>-future is the commoner, so also it is the one more indefinitely used. It expresses in general what is going to take place at some time to come \u2014 but often, as in other languages, adding on the one hand an implication of will or intention, or on the other hand that of promise or threatening.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"415481":{"pageid":415481,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/366","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\na.

''who is this? he is doubtless a god, or a Gandharva''; <tt>adya svapsyanti</tt> (MBh.) ''they must be sleeping now''.\n\nb. The spheres of future and desiderative border upon one another, and the one is sometimes met with where the other might be expected. Examples of the future taken in a quasi-desiderative sense are as follows: <tt>y\u00e1d d\u0101\u00e7\u00fa\u1e63e bhadr\u00e1\u1e41 kari\u1e63y\u00e1si t\u00e1v\u00e9 \u2019t t\u00e1t saty\u00e1m</tt> (RV.)

''as if, intending to say one thing, one were to say another''. \n\n949. The periphrastic future is defined by the grammarians as expressing something to be done at a definite time to come. And this, though but faintly traceable in later use, is a distinct characteristic of the formation in the language where it first makes its appearance. It is especially often used along with <tt>\u00e7v\u00e1s</tt> ''tomorrow''. \n\na. A few examples are: <tt>ady\u00e1 var\u1e63i\u1e63yati...\u00e7v\u00f3 vra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u0301</tt> (MS.)

A penultimate nasal is not seldom dropped: examples are <tt>akt\u00e1</tt> (\u221a<tt>a\u00f1j</tt>), <tt>baddh\u00e1</tt> (\u221a<tt>bandh</tt>), <tt>\u00e7rabdha</tt> (\u221a<tt>\u00e7rambh</tt>), <tt>da\u1e63\u1e6d\u00e1</tt> (\u221a<tt>da\u1e45\u00e7</tt>), <tt>srasta</tt> (\u221a<tt>sra\u1e45s</tt>), <tt>b\u0101\u1e0dha</tt> (\u221a<tt>ba\u1e45h</tt>).\n\nb.

A few roots in <tt>an</tt> make their participle from another root-form in <tt>\u0101</tt>: thus, <tt>kh\u0101t\u00e1, j\u0101t\u00e1</tt>, -<tt>v\u0101ta, s\u0101t\u00e1</tt>; <tt>dham</tt> has both <tt>dhamit\u00e1</tt> and <tt>dhm\u0101t\u00e1</tt>.\n\nc.

And <tt>\u00e1nna</tt> ''food'', in spite of its different accent, appears to be a like formation from \u221a<tt>ad</tt> ''eat''.\n\n958. The native grammarians reckon as participles of this formation a few miscellaneous derivative adjectives, coming from roots which do not make a regular participle: such are <tt>k\u1e63\u0101ma</tt> ''burnt'', <tt>k\u1e5b\u00e7\u00e1</tt> ''emaciated'', <tt>pakv\u00e1</tt> ''ripe'', <tt>phull\u00e1</tt> ''expanded'', <tt>\u00e7\u00fa\u1e63ka</tt> ''dry''.\n\n<center>Past Active Participle in <tt>tavant</tt> (or <tt>navant</tt>).</center>\n\n959. From the past passive participle, of whatever formation, is made, by adding the possessive suffix \u0935\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d <tt>vant</tt>, a secondary derivative having the meaning and construction of a perfect active participle: for example, \u0924\u0924\u094d \u0915\u0943\u0924\u0935\u093e\u0928\u094d <tt>t\u00e1t k\u1e5bt\u00e1v\u0101n</tt> ''having done that''; <tt>ta\u1e41 nig\u012br\u1e47av\u0101n</tt> ''having swallowed him down''. Its inflection is like that of other derivatives made with this suffix (452 ff.); its feminine ends in \u0935\u0924\u0940 <tt>vat\u012b</tt>; its accent remains on the participle.\n\n960. Derivative words of this formation are found in RV., but without anything like a participial value. The AV. has a single example, with participial meaning: <tt>a\u00e7it\u0101\u0301vaty \u00e1tith\u0101u</tt> ''one's guest having eaten'' (loc. abs.). In the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as also it is hardly met with. In the later language, however, it comes to be quite common. And there it is chiefly used predicatively, and oftenest without copula expressed, or with the value of a personal verb-form in a past tense: primarily, and not seldom, signifying immediate past, or having a true \"perfect\" value; but also (like the old perfect and the old aorist in later use) coming to be freely used for indefinite time, or with the value of the imperfect (779). For example: <tt>m\u0101\u1e41 na ka\u00e7cid d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dav\u0101n</tt> ''no one has seen'' (or ''saw'') ''me''; <tt>sa nakula\u1e41 vy\u0101p\u0101ditav\u0101n</tt> ''he destroyed the ichneumon''; or, with copula, <tt>mahat k\u1e5bcchram pr\u0101ptavaty asi</tt> ''thou hast fallen upon great misery''. Although originally and properly made only from transitive verbs (with an object, to which the participle in <tt>ta</tt> stands in the relation of an objective predicate), it is finally found also from intransitives: thus, <tt>c\u016btena sa\u1e41\u00e7ritavat\u012b</tt> (\u00c7.) ''has become united with the mango-tree''; <tt>gatavat\u012b</tt> (ib.) ''she has gone''.\n\na. The same participle is also made in the secondary conjugations: e. g. <tt>dar\u00e7itavant</tt> ''having shown'', <tt>prabodhitavant</tt> ''having awakened''.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"415694":{"pageid":415694,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/374","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>before the suffix: thus, <tt>itya, mitya, \u00e7r\u00fatya, st\u00fatya, k\u1e5btya</tt> (the only Vedic examples). \u2014 3.

The RV. has about forty examples of this gerundive, and the AV. adds half as many more. Except in <tt>bh\u0101vi\u00e1</tt> (once), the accent in RV. is always on the root; AV. has several cases of accent on the <tt>i</tt> of the suffix (hence written <tt>\u0101dy\u00e0, \u0101\u00e7y\u00e0, -vy\u0101dhy\u00e0, -dhar\u1e63y\u00e0</tt>). According to the grammarians, the accent is on the root or else the ending is circumflexed: always the former, if the <tt>ya</tt> follow a vowel.\n\n964. a. The suffix <tt>tavya</tt> is a secondary adjective derivative from the infinitival noun in <tt>tu</tt> (below, 968), made by adding the suffix <tt>ya</tt> (properly <tt>\u00eda</tt>, whence the accent <tt>y\u00e0</tt>), before which the final <tt>u</tt>, as usual (1203 a), has <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening, and is resolved into <tt>av</tt>.\n\nb. Hence, as regards both the form taken by the root and the use or omission of an auxiliary vowel <tt>i</tt> before the <tt>tavya</tt>, the rules are the same as for the formation of the infinitive (below, 968).\n\nc. No example of this formation is found in RV., and in AV. occur only two, <tt>janitavy\u00e0</tt> and <tt>hi\u1e45sitavy\u00e0</tt>. In the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a language it begins to be not rare, and is made both from the simple root and from the derived conjugational stems (next chapter); in the classical language it is still more frequent. According to the grammarians, the accent of the word is either circumflex on the final or acute on the penult: thus, <tt>kartavy\u00e0</tt> or <tt>kart\u00e1vya</tt>; in the accentuated texts, it is always the former (the accent <tt>t\u00e1vya</tt> given to certain gerundives in the Petersburg lexicons is an error, growing out of the ambiguous accentuation of \u00c7B.: 88 c).\n\n965. a. The suffix <tt>an\u012bya</tt> is in like manner the product of secondary derivation, made by adding the adjective suffix <tt>\u012bya</tt> (1215) to a ''nomen actionis'' formed by the common suffix <tt>ana</tt>.\n\nb. It follows, then, as regards its mode of formation, the rules for the suffix <tt>ana</tt> (below, 1150).\n\nc. This derivative also is unknown in RV., and in AV. is found only in <tt>upaj\u012bvan\u012b\u0301ya</tt> and <tt>\u0101mantran\u012b\u0301ya</tt> (in both of which, moreover, its distinct gerundive value admits of question). In the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as (where less than a dozen examples of it have been noted), and in the later language, it is less common than the gerundive in <tt>tavya</tt>. Its accent, as in all the derivatives with the suffix <tt>\u012bya</tt>, is on the penult: thus, <tt>kara\u1e47\u012b\u0301ya</tt>.\n\n966. Other formations of kindred value are found in the Veda as follows:\n\na. Gerundives in <tt>tua</tt> or <tt>tva</tt>, apparently made from the infinitival noun in <tt>tu</tt> with the added suffix <tt>a</tt> (1209).

A few adjectives in <tt>elima</tt>, as <tt>pacelima, bhidelima</tt> (only these quotable), are reckoned as gerundives by the grammarians.\n\n967. The division-line between participial and ordinary adjectives is less strictly drawn in Sanskrit than in the other Indo-European languages. Thus, adjectives in <tt>u</tt>, as will be seen later (1178), from secondary conjugational stems, have participial value; and in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as (with an example or two in AV.) is found widely and commonly used a participial adjective formed with the suffix <tt>uka</tt> (1180).\n\n<center>Infinitives.</center>\n\n968. The later language has only a single infinitive, which is the accusative case of a verbal noun formed by the suffix \u0924\u0941 <tt>tu</tt>, added to the root usually directly, but often also with aid of the preceding auxiliary vowel \u0907 <tt>i</tt>. The form of the infinitive ending, therefore, is \u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d <tt>tum</tt> or \u0907\u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d <tt>itum</tt>. The root has the <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening, and is accented. Thus, for example, \u090f\u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d <tt>\u00e9tum</tt> from \u221a\u0907 <tt>i</tt>; \u0915\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d <tt>k\u00e1rtum</tt> from \u221a\u0915\u0943 <tt>k\u1e5b</tt>; \u091a\u0930\u093f\u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d <tt>c\u00e1ritum</tt> from \u221a\u091a\u0930\u094d <tt>car</tt>; \u092d\u0935\u093f\u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d <tt>bh\u00e1vitum</tt> from \u221a\u092d\u0942 <tt>bh\u016b</tt>.\n\na. As regards the use or omission of <tt>i</tt>, the infinitive (as also the gerund in <tt>tv\u0101</tt>: 991) follows in general the analogy of the passive participle (956). Examples are (with the gerund added) as follows: <tt>dagdh\u00e1, d\u00e1gdhum, dagdhv\u0101\u0301</tt> from \u221a<tt>dah</tt>; <tt>bhinn\u00e1, bh\u00e9ttum, bhittv\u0101\u0301</tt> from \u221a<tt>bhid</tt>; <tt>mat\u00e1, m\u00e1ntum, matv\u0101\u0301</tt> from \u221a<tt>man</tt>; <tt>\u016b\u1e0dh\u00e1, v\u00f3\u1e0dhum, \u016b\u1e0dhv\u0101\u0301</tt> from \u221a<tt>vah</tt>; <tt>patit\u00e1, p\u00e1titum, patitv\u0101\u0301</tt> from \u221a<tt>pat</tt>; <tt>y\u0101cit\u00e1, y\u0101\u0301citum, y\u0101citv\u0101\u0301</tt> from \u221a<tt>y\u0101c</tt>; <tt>\u00e7ayit\u00e1, \u00e7\u00e1yitum, \u00e7ayitv\u0101\u0301</tt> from \u221a<tt>\u00e7\u012b</tt>.

In the Veda and Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, however, a number of verbal nouns, ''nomina actionis'', in various of their cases, are used in constructions which assimilate them to the infinitive of other languages \u2014 although, were it not for these other later and more developed and pronounced infinitives, the constructions in question might pass as ordinary case-constructions of a somewhat peculiar kind.\n\n970. The nouns thus used infinitively are the following:\n\na. The root-noun, without derivative suffix, is so used in its accusative in <tt>am</tt>, its dative in <tt>e</tt> or (from <tt>\u0101</tt>-roots) <tt>\u0101i</tt>, its genitive and ablative in <tt>as</tt>, and its locative in <tt>i</tt>.\n\nb. The verbal noun in <tt>tu</tt> is so used in its accusative in tum, its dative in <tt>tave</tt> or <tt>tav\u0101\u00ed</tt>, and its ablative and genitive in <tt>tos</tt>.\n\nOf other nouns only single cases, generally datives, are reckoned as used with infinitive value; thus:\n\nc. From the verbal noun in <tt>as</tt>, the dative in <tt>ase</tt>; and also, in an extremely small number of instances, a dative in <tt>se</tt> (or <tt>\u1e63e</tt>), from a noun formed with <tt>s</tt> simply.\n\nd. From nouns in <tt>man</tt> and <tt>van</tt>, datives in <tt>mane</tt> and <tt>vane</tt>.\n\ne. From nouns in <tt>ti</tt>, datives in <tt>taye</tt>, or (from one or two verbs) in <tt>ty\u0101i</tt>.\n\nf. From nouns in <tt>i</tt>, datives in <tt>\u00e1ye</tt>.\n\ng. From nouns in <tt>dhi</tt> and <tt>\u1e63i</tt>, datives in <tt>dhy\u0101i</tt> and <tt>\u1e63y\u0101i</tt>.\n\nh. A few infinitives in <tt>\u1e63a\u1e47i</tt> are perhaps locatives from nouns in <tt>an</tt> added to a root increased by <tt>s</tt>.\n\ni. From a single root, <tt>dh\u1e5b</tt>, are made infinitively used forms in <tt>t\u00e1ri</tt>, of which the grammatical character is questionable.\n\nj. Among all these, the forms which have best right to special treatment as infinitives, on account of being of peculiar formation, or from suffixes not found in other uses, or for both reasons, are those in <tt>\u1e63e, \u1e63a\u1e47i, tari, dhy\u0101i</tt>, and <tt>tav\u0101i</tt>.\n\nk. Except the various cases of the derivative in <tt>tu</tt>, and of the root-noun, these infinitives are almost wholly unknown outside the Rig-Veda.\n\nl. Other suffixes and forms than those noticed above might be added; for it is impossible to draw any fixed line between the uses classed as infinitive and the ordinary case-uses: thus, <tt>praj\u0101\u0301patim pra\u00e7n\u00e1m \u0101it\u0101m</tt> (TS.)

''for the rescue of the distressed, not for hurling at the innocent''.\n\nMore special rules as to the various formations are as follows:\n\n971. The root-noun used as infinitive has the same form (except that it does not take an added <tt>t</tt>: 383 f), and the same accent, both when simple and when combined with prepositions, as in its other uses. In the very great majority of instances, it is made from roots ending in a consonant; but also from a few in <tt>\u0101</tt> (<tt>khy\u0101, d\u0101, dh\u0101, p\u0101</tt>?, <tt>m\u0101, y\u0101</tt>), from two or three in <tt>i</tt>- and <tt>u</tt>-vowels (<tt>hi, m\u012b, bh\u016b</tt>), and from one or two in changeable <tt>\u1e5b</tt>, which takes the <tt>ir</tt>-form (<tt>tir, stir</tt>).\n\na. The roots in <tt>\u0101</tt> form the accus. in <tt>\u0101m</tt>, the dat. in <tt>\u0101i</tt>, the abl. in <tt>\u0101s</tt> (understanding <tt>avas\u0101\u0301</tt> before <tt>\u0101\u0301</tt> as for <tt>avas\u0101\u0301s</tt> and not <tt>avas\u0101\u00ed</tt> in RV. iii. 53. 20), and the locative in <tt>e</tt> (only two examples, of which one is perhaps better understood as dative).\n\n972. The infinitive noun in <tt>tu</tt> is made freely from roots of every form. The root takes the <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening, if capable of it, and often adds the auxiliary vowel <tt>i</tt> before the suffix (according to the rules already stated, 968). The root is accented, unless the noun be combined with a preposition, in which case the latter has the accent instead: thus, <tt>k\u00e1rtum, \u00e9tave, h\u00e1ntos</tt>; but <tt>n\u00edkartum, n\u00edretave, n\u00edrhantos</tt>.\n\na. The dative in <tt>tav\u0101i</tt> is in two respects anomalous: in having the heavy feminine ending <tt>\u0101i</tt> along with a strengthened <tt>u</tt>; and in taking a double accent, one on the root or on the prefixed preposition, and the other on the ending <tt>\u0101i</tt>: thus, <tt>\u00e9tav\u0101\u00ed, h\u00e1ntav\u0101\u00ed, \u00e1tyetav\u0101\u00ed, \u00e1pabhartav\u0101\u00ed</tt>.\n\n973. a. The infinitive in <tt>ase</tt> is made in RV. from about twenty-five roots; in AV. and later there have been noted no other examples of it. In near three quarters of the cases, the accent is on the suffix: e. g. <tt>\u1e5b\u00f1j\u00e1se, j\u012bv\u00e1se, bhiy\u00e1se, tuj\u00e1se</tt>; the exceptions are <tt>c\u00e1k\u1e63ase</tt>; <tt>dh\u0101\u0301yase</tt> (with <tt>y</tt> inserted before the suffix: 258); and <tt>\u00e1yase, bh\u00e1rase, sp\u00e1rase, h\u00e1rase</tt> (with <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening of the root). Strengthening of the root is also shown by <tt>jav\u00e1se, doh\u00e1se, bhoj\u00e1se, \u00e7obh\u00e1se</tt>. In <tt>pu\u1e63y\u00e1se</tt> is seen, apparently, the present-stem instead of the root.\n\nb. The ending <tt>se</tt> is extremely rare, being found only in <tt>ji\u1e63\u00e9</tt> and perhaps <tt>stu\u1e63\u00e9</tt>, and one or two still more doubtful cases.\n\n974. Infinitives in <tt>mane</tt> are made from only five roots: thus, <tt>tr\u0101\u0301ma\u1e47e, d\u0101\u0301mane, d\u00e1rma\u1e47e, bh\u00e1rma\u1e47e</tt>, and (with different accent) <tt>vidm\u00e1ne</tt>. From \u221a<tt>d\u0101</tt> comes <tt>d\u0101v\u00e1ne</tt>; <tt>turv\u00e1\u1e47e</tt> may come directly from \u221a<tt>t\u1e5b</tt>, or through the secondary root <tt>turv</tt>; <tt>dh\u016b\u0301rva\u1e47e</tt> is rather from \u221a<tt>dh\u016brv</tt> than from \u221a<tt>dhv\u1e5b</tt>.\n\n975. a. The infinitives in <tt>taye</tt> are <tt>i\u1e63\u1e6d\u00e1ye</tt> (\u221a<tt>i\u1e63</tt>), <tt>p\u012bt\u00e1ye</tt> (\u221a<tt>p\u0101</tt> ''drink''), <tt>v\u012bt\u00e1ye</tt>, <tt>s\u0101t\u00e1ye</tt>, and perhaps <tt>\u016bt\u00e1ye</tt> (<tt>\u016bt\u00e1ye n\u1e5d\u0301n</tt> ''to help his men'':<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"415699":{"pageid":415699,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/379","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>(RV.). In <tt>ty\u0101i</tt>, the only examples noted are <tt>ity\u0101\u00ed</tt> (RV.) and <tt>s\u0101\u0301\u1e0dhy\u0101i</tt> (MS. AB.).\n\nb. With <tt>aye</tt> are formed <tt>i\u1e63\u00e1ye, tuj\u00e1ye, d\u1e5b\u00e7\u00e1ye, mah\u00e1ye, yudh\u00e1ye, san\u00e1ye</tt>; and <tt>cit\u00e1ye</tt> (VS.), <tt>g\u1e5bhaye</tt> (K.).\n\n976. The ending <tt>dhy\u0101i</tt> is, more than any other, irregular and various in its treatment. It has always an <tt>a</tt> before it; and in the majority of cases it is accented upon this <tt>a</tt>, and added to a weak form of root: thus, <tt>\u00e7uc\u00e1dhy\u0101i, p\u1e5b\u1e47\u00e1dhy\u0101i, dhiy\u00e1dhy\u0101i, huv\u00e1dhy\u0101i</tt>. But the form of root is the strong one in a few cases: namely, <tt>\u00e7ay\u00e1dhy\u0101i, stav\u00e1dhy\u0101i, tar\u00e1dhy\u0101i, jar\u00e1dhy\u0101i, mand\u00e1dhy\u0101i, vand\u00e1dhy\u0101i</tt>. In half-a-dozen forms, again, the root has the accent: namely, <tt>k\u1e63\u00e1radhy\u0101i, g\u00e1madhy\u0101i, y\u00e1jadhy\u0101i</tt> (but once or twice also <tt>yaj\u00e1dhy\u0101i</tt>), <tt>v\u00e1hadhy\u0101i, s\u00e1hadhy\u0101i, bh\u00e1radhy\u0101i</tt>. In a single instance, <tt>p\u00edbadhy\u0101i</tt>, the suffix is added distinctly to a present-stem; and in one, <tt>v\u0101v\u1e5bdh\u00e1dhy\u0101i</tt>, to a perfect stem. Finally, in a number of instances (ten), this infinitive is made from a causative stem in <tt>ay</tt>: thus, <tt>m\u0101day\u00e1dhy\u0101i, ri\u1e63ay\u00e1dhy\u0101i</tt>, etc.\n\na. This infinitive is by no means rare in RV., being made in thirty-five different forms (with seventy-two occurrences). But it is hardly known outside of the RV.; the AV. has it but once (in a passage found also in RV.); and elsewhere half-a-dozen examples have been noticed, in <tt>mantra</tt>-passages (one of them TS. falsely reads <tt>g\u00e1madhye</tt>); in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a language proper it appears to be entirely wanting.\n\n977. An example or two are met with of an infinitive in <tt>\u1e63y\u0101i</tt>: thus, <tt>r\u00f3hi\u1e63y\u0101i</tt> (TS.), <tt>avyathi\u1e63y\u0101i</tt> (K. Kap.; MS. <tt>avy\u00e1thi\u1e63e</tt>; VS. <tt>vyathi\u1e63at</tt>), and perhaps -<tt>dh\u0101sy\u0101i</tt> (PGS.).\n\n978. The infinitives in <tt>\u1e63a\u1e47i</tt> are: <tt>i\u1e63\u00e1\u1e47i</tt> (?) from \u221a<tt>i\u1e63</tt> ''send'', -<tt>bh\u016b\u1e63\u00e1\u1e47i</tt> from \u221a<tt>bh\u016b</tt>; <tt>\u00e7\u016b\u1e63\u00e1\u1e47i</tt> from \u221a<tt>\u00e7\u016b</tt> or <tt>\u00e7v\u0101</tt>; <tt>ne\u1e63\u00e1\u1e47i</tt> from \u221a<tt>n\u012b</tt>; <tt>sak\u1e63\u00e1\u1e47i</tt> from \u221a<tt>sah</tt>; <tt>par\u1e63\u00e1\u1e47i</tt> from \u221a<tt>p\u1e5b</tt>, <tt>tar\u012b\u1e63\u00e1\u1e47i</tt> from \u221a<tt>t\u1e5b</tt>; and <tt>g\u1e5b\u1e47\u012b\u1e63\u00e1\u1e47i</tt> and -<tt>st\u1e5b\u1e47\u012b\u1e63\u00e1\u1e47i</tt> from \u221a\u221a<tt>g\u1e5b</tt> and <tt>st\u1e5b</tt> \u2014 the last containing evident present tense-signs (compare the 1st sing. <tt>g\u1e5b\u1e47\u012b\u1e63\u00e9</tt>, 894 d).\n\n979. The only infinitive in <tt>tari</tt> is <tt>dhart\u00e1ri</tt> (with its compound <tt>vidhart\u00e1ri</tt>), from \u221a<tt>dh\u1e5b</tt>.\n\n<center>Uses of the Infinitives.</center>\n\n980. The uses of the so-called infinitives are for the most part closely accordant with those of the corresponding cases from other abstract nouns. Thus:\n\n981. The accusative, which is made only from the root-noun and the noun in <tt>tu</tt>, is used as object of a verb.\n\na.

''therefore one should not be careful to smother the fire''; \u2014 and of others.\n\n982. Of the infinitive datives, the fundamental and usual sense is that expressed by ''for, in order to, for the purpose of''.\n\nExamples are: <tt>v\u00ed\u00e7a\u1e41 j\u012bv\u00e1\u1e41 car\u00e1se bodh\u00e1yant\u012b</tt> (RV.)

''give us sight for looking abroad''.\n\nSome peculiar constructions, however, grow out of this use of the infinitive dative. Thus:\n\na. The noun which is logically the subject or the object of the action expressed by the infinitive is frequently put beside it in the dative (by a construction which is in part a perfectly simple one, but which is stretched beyond its natural boundaries by a kind of attraction): thus, <tt>cak\u0101ra s\u016b\u0301ry\u0101ya p\u00e1nth\u0101m \u00e1nvetav\u0101\u0301 u</tt> (RV.)

''may they grant life again, that we may see the sun''.\n\nb. An infinitive with \u221a<tt>k\u1e5b</tt> ''make'' is used nearly in the sense of a causative verb: thus, <tt>pr\u0101\u0301 \u2019ndh\u00e1\u1e41 \u00e7ro\u1e47\u00e1\u1e41 c\u00e1k\u1e63asa \u00e9tave k\u1e5btha\u1e25</tt> (RV.) ''ye make the blind and lame to see and go''; <tt>agn\u00ed\u1e41 sam\u00eddhe cak\u00e1rtha</tt> (RV.) ''thou hast made the fire to be kindled''. Of similar character is an occasional construction with another verb: as, <tt>y\u00e1d \u012bm u\u00e7m\u00e1si k\u00e1rtave k\u00e1rat t\u00e1t</tt> (RV.)

The infinitives in <tt>dhy\u0101i</tt> and <tt>\u1e63a\u1e47i</tt> (which latter is in all its uses accordant with datives) are those in which the imperative value is most distinctly to be recognized.\n\ne. In the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as and S\u016btras (especially in \u00c7B.) the dative in <tt>tav\u0101i</tt> is not seldom used with a verb signifying ''speak'' (<tt>br\u016b, vac, ah</tt>), to express the ordering of anything to be done: thus, <tt>t\u00e1sm\u0101d \u00f3\u1e63adh\u012bn\u0101m ev\u00e1 m\u016b\u0301l\u0101ny \u00facchettav\u0101\u00ed br\u016by\u0101t</tt> (\u00c7B.) ''therefore let him direct the roots of the plants to be cut up'' (''speak in order to their cutting up'': cf. <tt>y\u00e9 va\u00e7\u0101\u0301y\u0101 \u00e1d\u0101n\u0101ya v\u00e1danti</tt> ''who dissuade from giving the cow'': AV.).\n\n983. The ablative infinitive \u2014 which, like the accusative, is made only from the root-noun and that in <tt>tu</tt> \u2014 is found especially with the prepositions <tt>\u0101\u0301</tt> ''until'' and <tt>pur\u0101\u0301</tt> ''before''.\n\na. Thus, <tt>\u0101\u0301 t\u00e1mito\u1e25</tt> (TS. etc.) ''until exhaustion''; <tt>pur\u0101\u0301 v\u0101c\u00e1\u1e25 pr\u00e1vadito\u1e25</tt> (TS.) ''before utterance of the voice''. In the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a language,  this is the well-nigh exclusive construction of the ablative (it occurs also with <tt>pr\u0101k, arv\u0101k</tt>, etc.); in the Veda, the latter is used also after <tt>\u1e5bt\u00e9</tt> ''without'', and after several verbs, as <tt>tr\u0101</tt> and <tt>p\u0101</tt> ''protect'', <tt>yu</tt> ''separate'', <tt>bh\u012b</tt>, etc.\n\nb. In a few instances, by an attraction similar to that illustrated above for the dative (982 a), a noun dependent on this infinitive is put in the ablative beside it: thus, <tt>pur\u0101 v\u0101gbhya\u1e25 sampravadito\u1e25</tt> (PB.) ''before the utterance together of the voices''; <tt>tr\u0101\u0301dhva\u1e41 kart\u0101\u0301d avap\u00e1da\u1e25</tt> (RV.) ''save us from falling down into the pit''; <tt>pur\u0101 dak\u1e63i\u1e47\u0101bhyo neto\u1e25</tt> (\u0100past.) ''before the gifts are taken away''.\n\n984. The genitive infinitive (having the same form as the ablative) is in common use in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a language as dependent on <tt>\u012b\u00e7var\u00e1</tt> ''lord, master'', employed adjectively in the sense of ''capable'' or ''likely'' or ''exposed to''.\n\na. Examples are: <tt>t\u0101\u0301</tt> [<tt>dev\u00e1t\u0101\u1e25</tt>] <tt>\u012b\u00e7var\u0101\u0301 enam prad\u00e1ha\u1e25</tt> (TS.)

''the rathantara is liable to knock out the eye of the chanter''.\n\nb. The dative is used in \u00c7B. instead of the genitive in a single phrase (<tt>\u012b\u00e7var\u0101\u00fa j\u00e1nayitav\u0101\u00ed</tt>); and, in the later language, sometimes the accusative in turn. In a case or two the masc. sing. nom. <tt>\u012b\u00e7vara\u1e25</tt> is used, without regard to the gender or number of the word which it qualifies: thus, <tt>t\u00e1sye \u201d\u00e7var\u00e1\u1e25 praj\u0101\u0301 p\u0101\u0301p\u012byas\u012b bh\u00e1vito\u1e25</tt> (\u00c7B.) ''his progeny is liable to deteriorate''. And in a very few instances the word <tt>\u012b\u00e7vara</tt> is omitted, and the genitive has the same value without it: thus, <tt>dve madhya\u1e41dinam abhi pratyeto\u1e25</tt> (AB.) ''two may be added to the noon libation''; <tt>t\u00e1to d\u012bk\u1e63it\u00e1\u1e25 p\u0101man\u00f3 bh\u00e1vito\u1e25</tt> (\u00c7B.) ''then the consecrated is liable to get the itch''.\n\nc. This construction with <tt>\u012b\u00e7vara</tt>, which is the only one for the genitive infinitive in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, is unknown in the Veda, where the genitive is found in a very small number of examples with <tt>madhy\u0101\u0301</tt>, and with the root <tt>\u012b\u00e7</tt>: thus, <tt>madhy\u0101\u0301 k\u00e1rto\u1e25</tt> (RV.) ''in the midst of action''; <tt>\u012b\u0301\u00e7e r\u0101y\u00f3 d\u0101\u0301to\u1e25</tt> (RV.) ''he is master of the giving of wealth''; <tt>\u012b\u0301\u00e7e y\u00f3to\u1e25</tt> (RV.) ''is able to keep away''.\n\n985. Unless the infinitives in <tt>\u1e63a\u1e47i</tt> and <tt>tari</tt> are locative in form (their uses are those of datives), the locative infinitive is so rare, and has so little that is peculiar in its use, that it is hardly worth making any account of. An example is <tt>u\u1e63\u00e1so budh\u00ed</tt> (RV.) ''at the awakening of the dawn''.\n\n986. In the Veda, the dative infinitive forms are very much more numerous than the accusative (in RV., their occurrences are twelve times as many; in AV., more than three times); and the accusative in <tt>tum</tt> is rare (only four forms in RV., only eight in AV.). In the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the accusative has risen to much greater comparative frequency (its forms are nearly twice as many as those of the dative); but the ablative-genitive, which is rare in the Veda, has also come to full equality with it. The disappearance in the classical language of all excepting the accusative in <tt>tum</tt> (but see 968 h) is a matter for no small surprise. \n\n987. The later infinitive in tum is oftenest used in constructions corresponding to those of the earlier accusative: thus, <tt>na v\u0101\u1e63pam a\u00e7akat so\u1e0dhurn</tt> ''he could not restrain his tears''; <tt>ta\u1e41 dra\u1e63\u1e6dum arhasi</tt> ''thou oughtest to see it''; <tt>pr\u0101ptum icchanti</tt> ''they desire to obtain''; <tt>sa\u1e41khy\u0101tum \u0101rabdham</tt> ''having begun to count''. But also, not infrequently, in those of the other cases. So, especially, of the dative: thus, <tt>avasth\u0101tu\u1e41 sth\u0101n\u0101ntara\u1e41 cintaya</tt> ''devise another place to stay in''; <tt>tv\u0101m anve\u1e63\u1e6dum ih\u0101 \u201dgata\u1e25</tt> ''he has come hither to seek for thee''; \u2014 but likewise of the genitive: thus, <tt>samartho gantum</tt> ''capable of going''; <tt>sa\u1e41dh\u0101tum \u012b\u00e7vara\u1e25</tt> ''able to mend''. Even a construction as nominative is not unknown: thus, <tt>yukta\u1e41 tasya may\u0101 {{hws|sam\u0101\u00e7v\u0101|sam\u0101\u00e7v\u0101sayitum}}</tt><noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"415703":{"pageid":415703,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/383","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><tt>{{hwe|sayitum|sam\u0101\u00e7v\u0101sayitum}} bh\u0101ry\u0101m</tt> (MBh.)

''it is not suitable thus to curse one's own grandson''; <tt>tad vaktu\u1e41 na p\u0101ryate</tt> (\u00c7atr.) ''it is not possible to say that''.\n\n988. In the later language, as in the earlier, the infinitive in certain connections has what we look upon as a passive value. Thus, <tt>kartum \u0101rabdha\u1e25</tt> ''begun to be made''; <tt>\u00e7rotu\u1e41 na yujyate</tt> ''it is not fit to be heard'' (''for hearing''). This is especially frequent along with the passive forms of \u221a<tt>\u00e7ak</tt>: thus, <tt>tyaktu\u1e41 na \u00e7akyate</tt> ''it cannot be abandoned''; <tt>\u00e7aky\u0101v ih\u0101 \u201dnetum</tt> ''they two can be brought hither''; <tt>na ca vibh\u016btaya\u1e25 \u00e7akyam av\u0101ptum \u016brjit\u0101\u1e25</tt> ''nor are mighty successes a thing capable of being attained''.\n\n\n<center>Gerunds.</center>\n\n989. The so-called gerund is a stereotyped case (doubtless instrumental) of a verbal noun, used generally as adjunct to the logical subject of a clause, denoting an accompanying or (more often) a preceding action to that signified by the verb of the clause. It has thus the virtual value of an indeclinable participle, present or past, qualifying the actor whose action it describes.\n\na. Thus, for example: <tt>\u00e7rutv\u0101i \u2019va c\u0101 \u2019bruvan</tt> ''and hearing'' (or ''having heard'') ''they spoke''; <tt>tebhya\u1e25 pratij\u00f1\u0101y\u0101 \u2019th\u0101i \u2019t\u0101n paripapraccha</tt> ''having given them his promise, he then questioned them''.\n\n990. The gerund is made in the later language by one of the two suffixes \u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e <tt>tv\u0101</tt> and \u092f <tt>ya</tt>, the former being used with a simple root, the latter with one that is compounded with a prepositional prefix \u2014 or, rarely, with an element of another kind, as adverb or noun.\n\na. To this distribution of uses between the two suffixes there are occasional exceptions. Thus, gerunds in <tt>ya</tt> from simple roots are not very rare in the epic language (e. g. <tt>g\u1e5bhya, u\u1e63ya</tt> [\u221a<tt>vas</tt> ''dwell''], <tt>arcya, \u012bk\u1e63ya, cintya, tyajya, lak\u1e63ya</tt>; also from causatives and denominatives, as <tt>v\u0101cya, yojya, pl\u0101vya</tt>), and are not unknown elsewhere (e. g. <tt>arcya</tt> and <tt>\u012bk\u1e63ya</tt> M., <tt>prothya</tt> AGS., <tt>sth\u0101pya</tt> \u00c7vU.). And gerunds in <tt>tv\u0101</tt> from compounded roots are met with in considerable numbers from AV. (only <tt>pratyarpayitv\u0101\u0301</tt>) down: e. g. <tt>sam\u012brayitv\u0101\u0301</tt> MS., <tt>virocayitv\u0101\u0301</tt> TA., <tt>utk\u1e63iptv\u0101</tt> U., <tt>pratyuktv\u0101</tt> E., <tt>pratyasitv\u0101</tt> S., <tt>prahasitv\u0101</tt> MBh., <tt>sa\u1e41dar\u00e7ayitv\u0101</tt> MBh., <tt>vimuktv\u0101</tt> R., <tt>nivedayitv\u0101</tt> R., <tt>proktv\u0101</tt> Pa\u00f1c., <tt>anup\u012btva</tt> VBS.: the great majority of them are made from the causative stem.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"415704":{"pageid":415704,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/384","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\nb. The prefixion of the negative particle, <tt>a</tt> or <tt>an</tt>, does not cause the gerund to take the form in <tt>ya</tt>: thus, <tt>ak\u1e5btv\u0101, am\u012brayitv\u0101</tt> (but R. has <tt>acintya</tt>). Of compounds with other than verbal prefixes, RV. has <tt>punard\u0101\u0301ya, kar\u1e47ag\u1e5b\u0301hya, p\u0101dag\u1e5b\u0301hya, hastag\u1e5b\u0301hya, ara\u1e41k\u1e5b\u0301tya, akkhal\u012bk\u1e5b\u0301tya, mithasp\u1e5b\u0301dhya</tt>; AV. has further <tt>namask\u1e5b\u0301tya</tt>.\n\n991.

It is usually added directly to the root, hut often also with interposition of the auxiliary vowel \u0907 <tt>i</tt> \u2014 with regard to which, as well as to the form of the root before it, the formation nearly agrees with that of the participle in \u0924 <tt>ta</tt> (952 ff.).\n\na. Examples of the general accordance of passive participle, infinitive, and gerund in regard to the use of <tt>i</tt> were given above, 968 a; farther specifications are called for, as follows:\n\nb. The quotable roots in variable <tt>\u1e5b</tt> (242) change it to <tt>\u012br</tt>: thus, <tt>t\u012brtv\u0101\u0301, st\u012brtv\u0101\u0301</tt> (also <tt>st\u1e5btv\u0101\u0301</tt>); and <tt>car</tt> makes also <tt>c\u012brtv\u0101</tt> (like <tt>c\u012br\u1e47a</tt>); \u2014 roots in <tt>\u0101</tt> show in general the same weakening as in the participle; but from <tt>dh\u0101</tt> ''put'' is quotable only <tt>dhitv\u0101\u0301</tt>, from <tt>m\u0101</tt> ''measure'' <tt>mitv\u0101\u0301</tt> and <tt>m\u012btv\u0101</tt>, from <tt>d\u0101</tt> ''give'' only <tt>dattv\u0101\u0301</tt>, from <tt>ch\u0101 ch\u0101yitv\u0101</tt>; \u2014 of roots in <tt>am, kram</tt> and <tt>bhram</tt> and <tt>yam</tt> make forms both with and without <tt>i</tt> (as in the infinitive), but <tt>ram</tt> has <tt>ratv\u0101\u0301</tt> and <tt>ra\u1e41tv\u0101</tt>, and <tt>dam</tt> and <tt>vam</tt> make <tt>damitv\u0101</tt> and <tt>vamitv\u0101</tt>.\n\nc. The auxiliary vowel is taken by roots <tt>gras, mu\u1e63, \u00e7ap</tt>, and <tt>\u00e7\u0101s</tt> (<tt>\u00e7\u0101sitv\u0101</tt>) (whose participles have both forms); also by <tt>c\u0101y, n\u1e5bt</tt> (<tt>nartitv\u0101</tt>), <tt>lag</tt>, and <tt>svaj</tt> (against analogy of pple); and <tt>\u00e7uc</tt> makes <tt>\u00e7ocitv\u0101</tt>. On the other hand, from <tt>ruj</tt> (<tt>rug\u1e47a</tt>) and <tt>vra\u00e7c</tt> (<tt>v\u1e5bk\u1e47a</tt>) come <tt>ruktv\u0101\u0301</tt> and <tt>v\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101\u0301</tt>.

According to the grammarians, there may be formed from some verbs, for passive use, a special stem for the aorist and the two future systems, coinciding in form with the peculiar 3d sing. aorist.\n\nf. Thus, from \u221a<tt>d\u0101</tt> (aor. 3d sing. <tt>ad\u0101yi</tt>), beside <tt>\u00e1d\u0101si, d\u0101sy\u00e9, d\u0101t\u0101\u0301he</tt>, also <tt>\u00e1d\u0101yi\u1e63i, d\u0101yi\u1e63y\u00e9, d\u0101yit\u0101\u0301he</tt>. The permission to make this doable formation extends to all roots ending in vowels, and to <tt>grah, d\u1e5b\u00e7, and han</tt>. No such passive forms occur in the older language, and not half-a-dozen are quotable from the later (we find <tt>adh\u0101yi\u1e63i</tt> and <tt>asth\u0101yi\u1e63i</tt> in DKC., and <tt>an\u0101yi\u1e63ata</tt> in Kuval.).\n\ng. As to the alleged passive inflection of the periphrastic perfect, see below, 1072.\n\nh. Besides the participle from the present tense-stem (771. 5), the passive has a past participle in \u0924 <tt>ta</tt> (952), or \u0928 <tt>na</tt> (957), and future participles, or gerundives, of various formation (961 ff.), made directly from the root.\n\n999. As already pointed out (282 a), the language, especially later, has a decided predilection for the passive form of the sentence. This is given in part by the use of finite passive forms, but oftener by that of the passive participle and of the gerundive: the participle being taken in part in a present sense, but more usually in a past (whether indefinite or proximate past), and sometimes with a copula expressed, but much oftener without it; and the gerundive representing either a pure future or one with the sense of necessity or duty added. A further example is: <tt>tatr\u0101i \u2019ko yuv\u0101 br\u0101hma\u1e47o d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25: ta\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 k\u0101mena p\u012b\u1e0dit\u0101 sa\u1e41j\u0101t\u0101: sakhy\u0101 agre kathitam: sakhi puru\u1e63o \u2018ya\u1e41 g\u1e5bh\u012btv\u0101 mama m\u0101tu\u1e25 sam\u012bpam \u0101netavya\u1e25</tt> (Vet.) ''there she saw a young Brahman; at sight of him she felt the pangs of love; she said to her friend: 'friend, you must take and bring this man to my mother'.'' In some styles of later Sanskrit, the prevailing expression of past time is by means of the passive participle (thus, in Vet., an extreme case, more than nine tenths).\n\na. As in other languages, a 3d sing, passive is freely made from intransitive as well as transitive verbs: thus, <tt>ih\u0101 \u201dgamyat\u0101m</tt> ''come hither''; <tt>tvay\u0101 tatr\u0101i \u2019va sth\u012byat\u0101m</tt> ''do you stand just there''; <tt>sarv\u0101ir j\u0101lam \u0101d\u0101yo</tt> \u2019\u1e0d\u1e0d\u012byat\u0101m (H.)

A single exception as to the quantity of the <tt>i</tt> is <tt>davidh\u0101va</tt>.\n\ng. This method of reduplication is followed in the older language by about thirty roots.

The model of normal intensive inflection is the present-system of the reduplicating conjugation-class (642 ff.); and this is indeed to a considerable extent followed, in respect to endings, strengthening of stem, and accent. But deviations from the model are not rare; and the forms are in general of too infrequent occurrence to allow of satisfactory classification and explanation.\n\na. The most marked irregularity is the frequent insertion of an <tt>\u012b</tt> between the stem and ending. According to the grammarians, this is allowed in all the strong forms before an ending beginning with a consonant; and before the <tt>\u012b</tt> a final vowel has <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening, but a medial one remains unchanged.\n\n<center>Present-System.</center>\n\n1005.

Derivative Middle Inflection. From every intensive stem, as above described, may be formed in the present-system a further derivative conjugation which is formally identical with a passive, being made by the accented sign \u092f <tt>y\u00e1</tt>, along with middle endings only. It has not, however, a passive value, but is in meaning and use indistinguishable from the simpler conjugation.\n\na. A final vowel before this <tt>ya</tt> is treated as before the passive-sign <tt>ya</tt> (770).\n\nb. The inflection is precisely like that of any other stem ending in <tt>a</tt> in the middle voice: thus, from \u221a<tt>m\u1e5bj</tt>, intensive stem <tt>marm\u1e5bj</tt>, is made the present indicative <tt>marm\u1e5bjy\u00e9, marm\u1e5bjy\u00e1se, marm\u1e5bjy\u00e1te</tt>, etc.; optative <tt>marm\u1e5bjy\u00e9ya, marm\u1e5bjy\u00e9th\u0101s, marm\u1e5bjy\u00e9ta</tt>, etc.; imperative <tt>marm\u1e5bjy\u00e1sva, marm\u1e5bjy\u00e1t\u0101m</tt>, etc.; participle <tt>marm\u1e5bjy\u00e1m\u0101na</tt>; imperfect <tt>\u00e1marm\u1e5bjye, \u00e1marm\u1e5bjyath\u0101s, \u00e1marm\u1e5bjyata</tt>, etc.; subjunctive forms do not occur.\n\nc. In a very few sporadic cases, these <tt>y\u00e1</tt>-forms are given a passive value: thus, <tt>jan\u0304ghanyam\u0101na</tt> in M\u1e0dU.; <tt>bambhramyate, d\u0101dhm\u0101yam\u0101na, pep\u012byam\u0101na</tt> in the later language.

This kind of intensive inflection is more common than the other in the later language; in the earlier, it is comparatively rare.\n\na. In RV., <tt>y\u00e1</tt>-forms are made from eight roots, five of which have also forms of the simpler conjugation; the AV. adds one more; the other earlier texts (so far as observed) about twenty more, and half of them have likewise forms of the simpler conjugation.

The grammarians are at variance as to whether a perfect may be formed directly from the intensive stem, or whether only a periphrastic perfect (below, 1070 ff.) is to be admitted. \n\na. No example of an intensive periphrastic perfect has anywhere come to light (except from <tt>j\u0101g\u1e5b</tt>: 1020 a). A few unmistakable perfect forms are made from the intensively reduplicated root in RV.: namely, <tt>davidh\u0101va</tt> and <tt>n\u00f3n\u0101va</tt>, 3d sing., and <tt>nonuvus</tt>, 3d pl.; and there occur further <tt>dodr\u0101va</tt> (TS.), <tt>yoy\u0101va</tt> and <tt>lel\u0101\u0301ya</tt> (MS.), and <tt>lel\u00e1ya</tt> (? \u00c7B.), all used in the sense of presents. To them may be added <tt>j\u0101gara</tt> 1st sing. and <tt>j\u0101g\u0101\u0301ra</tt> 3d sing.: but as to these, see below, 1020 a.\n\n<center>Aorist, Future, etc.</center>\n\n1019. As to the remaining parts of a full verbal conjugation, also, the grammarians are not agreed (occurrences of such forms, apparently, being too rare to afford even them any basis for rules); in general, it is allowed to treat the intensive stem further as a root in filling up the scheme of forms, using always the auxiliary vowel \u0907 <tt>i</tt> where it is ever used in the simple conjugation. \n\na. Thus, from \u221a<tt>vid</tt>, intensive stem <tt>vevid</tt>, would be made the aorist <tt>avevidi\u1e63am</tt> with precative <tt>vevidy\u0101sam</tt>, the futures <tt>vevidi\u1e63y\u0101mi</tt> and <tt>vevidit\u0101smi</tt>, the participles <tt>vevidita, veviditavya</tt>, etc., the infinitive <tt>veviditum</tt>, and the gerunds <tt>veviditv\u0101</tt> and -<tt>vevidya</tt>. And, where the intensive conjugation is the derivative middle one, the aorist and futures would take the corresponding middle form.\n\nb. Of all this, in the ancient language, there is hardly a trace. The RV. has <tt>c\u00e1rk\u1e5b\u1e63e</tt>, 3d sing. mid., of a formation like <tt>hi\u1e63e</tt> and <tt>stu\u1e63\u00e9</tt> (894 d), and the gerundives <tt>vitantas\u0101\u0301yya</tt>, and <tt>marm\u1e5bj\u00e9nya</tt> and <tt>v\u0101v\u1e5bdh\u00e9nya</tt>; and \u00c7B. has the participle <tt>van\u012bv\u0101hit\u00e1</tt>, and the infinitive <tt>d\u00e9d\u012byitav\u0101\u00ed</tt>.

There are systems of inflection of certain roots, the intensive character of which is questioned or questionable. Thus: \n\na. The root <tt>g\u1e5b</tt> (or <tt>gar</tt>) ''wake'' has from the first no present-system save one with intensive reduplication; and its intensive stem, <tt>j\u0101g\u1e5b</tt>, begins early to assume the value of a root, and form a completer conjugation; while by the grammarians this stem is reckoned as if simple and belonging to the root-class, and is inflected throughout accordingly.

The old aorist (RV.) is the usual reduplicated or so-called causative aorist: thus, <tt>\u00e1j\u012bgar</tt>. The grammarians give it in the later language a perfect with additional reduplication, <tt>jaj\u0101g\u0101ra</tt> etc., an <tt>i\u1e63</tt>-aorist, <tt>aj\u0101gari\u1e63am</tt>, with precative <tt>j\u0101gary\u0101sam</tt>, and everything else that is needed to make up a complete conjugation. The perf. <tt>jaj\u0101g\u0101ra</tt> is quotable from the epics and later, as also the periphrastic <tt>j\u0101gar\u0101m \u0101sa</tt>. And MBh. has the mutilated <tt>j\u0101g\u1e5bmi</tt>, and also <tt>a</tt>-forms, as <tt>j\u0101garati</tt> and <tt>j\u0101gram\u0101\u1e47a</tt>.\n\n1021. a. The stem <tt>irajya</tt> (active only) ''regulate'', from which a number of forms are made in RV., has been viewed as an intensive from \u221a<tt>raj</tt> or <tt>\u1e5bj</tt>. It lacks, however, any analogy with the intensive formation. The same is true of <tt>iradh</tt> ''propitiate'' (only <tt>iradhanta</tt> and <tt>ir\u00e1dhy\u0101i</tt>, apparently for <tt>iradhadhy\u0101i</tt>).\n\nb. The middle stem <tt>\u012b\u0301ya</tt>, not infrequent in the oldest language, is often called an intensive of \u221a<tt>i</tt> ''go'', but without any propriety, as it has no analogy of form whatever with an intensive. The isolated 1st pl. <tt>\u012bmahe</tt>, common in RV., is of questionable character.\n\n1022. The root <tt>l\u012b</tt> ''totter'', with constant intensive reduplication, <tt>lel\u012b</tt>, is quite irregular in inflection and accent: thus, pres., <tt>lel\u0101\u0301yati</tt> and <tt>lel\u0101yate</tt>, pples <tt>lel\u0101y\u00e1nt\u012b</tt> and <tt>lel\u00e1yatas</tt> (gen. sing.) and <tt>lel\u0101yam\u0101na</tt>, impf. <tt>alel\u0101yat</tt> and <tt>alelet</tt> and <tt>alel\u012byata</tt>, perf. <tt>lel\u0101ya</tt> and <tt>lel\u00e1ya</tt> (?).\n\n1023. The RV. anomalous form <tt>dart</tt> (or <tt>dard</tt>), 2d and 3d sing. from \u221a<tt>d\u1e5b</tt> or <tt>dar</tt>, is doubtfully referred to the intensive, as if abbreviated from <tt>dardar</tt>. RV. has once <tt>avar\u012bvus</tt> (or -<tt>vur</tt>) where the sense requires a form from \u221a<tt>v\u1e5bt</tt>, as <tt>avar\u012bv\u1e5btus</tt>. The form <tt>rar\u0101\u1e47\u00e1t\u0101</tt> (RV., once) seems corrupt.\n\n1024. A marked intensive or frequentative meaning is not always easily to be traced in the forms classed as intensive; and in some of them it is quite effaced. Thus, the roots <tt>cit, nij, vi\u1e63</tt> use their intensive present-system as if it were an ordinary conjugation-class; nor is it otherwise with <tt>g\u1e5b</tt> (<tt>j\u0101g\u1e5b</tt>). The grammarians reckon the inflection of <tt>nij</tt> and <tt>vi\u1e63</tt> as belonging to the reduplicating present-system, with irregularly strengthened reduplication; and they treat in the same way <tt>vic</tt> and <tt>vij</tt>; <tt>j\u0101g\u1e5b</tt>, as we have seen, they account a simple root.\n\na. Also <tt>daridr\u0101</tt>, intensive of \u221a<tt>dr\u0101</tt> ''run'', is made by the grammarians a simple root, and furnished with a complete set of conjugational forms: as <tt>dadaridr\u0101u</tt>; <tt>adaridr\u0101s\u012bt</tt>, etc. etc. It does not occur in the older language (unless <tt>d\u00e1ridrat</tt> TS., for which VS. MS. read <tt>d\u00e1ridra</tt>). The so-called root <tt>vev\u012b</tt> ''flutter'' is a pure intensive.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"415845":{"pageid":415845,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/400","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\n1025. It is allowed by the grammarians to make from the intensive stem also a passive, desiderative, causative, and so on: thus, from <tt>vevid</tt>, pass. <tt>vevidy\u00e9</tt>; desid. <tt>v\u00e9vidi\u1e63\u0101mi</tt>; caus. <tt>vevid\u00e1y\u0101mi</tt>; desid. of causative, <tt>v\u00e9vidayi\u1e63\u0101mi</tt>. But such formations are excessively rare; quotable are <tt>var\u012bvarj\u00e1yant\u012b</tt> AV., <tt>j\u0101gar\u00e1yant</tt> TB. etc.; <tt>d\u0101dh\u0101rayati</tt> JB., <tt>danda\u00e7ayitv\u0101</tt> DKC.\n\n<center>III. Desiderative.</center>\n\n1026. By the desiderative conjugation is signified a desire for the action or condition denoted by the simple root: thus, \u092a\u093f\u092c\u093e\u092e\u093f <tt>p\u00edb\u0101mi</tt> ''I drink'', desid. \u092a\u093f\u092a\u093e\u0938\u093e\u092e\u093f <tt>p\u00edp\u0101s\u0101mi</tt> ''I wish to drink''; \u091c\u0940\u0935\u093e\u092e\u093f <tt>j\u012b\u0301v\u0101mi</tt> ''I live'', desid. \u091c\u093f\u091c\u0940\u0935\u093f\u0937\u093e\u092e\u093f <tt>j\u00edj\u012bvi\u1e63\u0101mi</tt> ''I desire to live''. Such a conjugation is allowed to be formed from any simple root in the language, and also from any causative stem.\n\na. The desiderative conjugation, although its forms outside the present-system are extremely rare in the oldest language, is earlier and more fully expanded into a whole verbal system than the intensive. Its forms are also of increasing frequency: much fewer than the intensives in RV., more numerous in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as and later; not one third of the whole number of roots (about a hundred) noted as having a desiderative conjugation in Veda and Br\u0101hma\u1e47a have such in RV.\n\n1027. The desiderative stem is formed from the simple root by the addition of two characteristics. 1. a reduplication, which always has the accent; 2. an appended \u0938 <tt>sa</tt> \u2014 which, however (like the tense-signs of aorist and future), sometimes takes before it the auxiliary vowel \u0907 <tt>i</tt>, becoming \u0907\u0937 <tt>i\u1e63a</tt>.\n\na. A few instances in the concluding part of \u00c7B. in which the accent is otherwise laid \u2014 thus, <tt>ti\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101\u0301set, yiy\u0101s\u00e1ntam, vividi\u1e63\u00e1nti, \u012bps\u00e1ntas</tt> \u2014 must probably be regarded as errors.\n\n1028. The root in general remains unchanged; but with the following exceptions:\n\na. A final <tt>i</tt> or <tt>u</tt> is lengthened before <tt>sa</tt>: thus, <tt>cik\u1e63\u012b\u1e63a, cik\u012b\u1e63a, jig\u012b\u1e63a</tt>; <tt>\u00e7u\u00e7r\u016b\u1e63a, juh\u016b\u1e63a, cuk\u1e63\u016b\u1e63a</tt>.\n\nb. A final <tt>\u1e5b</tt> becomes <tt>\u012br</tt> or <tt>\u016br</tt> before <tt>sa</tt>: thus, <tt>cik\u012br\u1e63a, tit\u012br\u1e63a</tt> (also irregularly <tt>t\u016bt\u016br\u1e63a</tt> RV.), <tt>didh\u012br\u1e63a, sis\u012br\u1e63a, tist\u012br\u1e63a</tt> (also <tt>tust\u016br\u1e63a</tt>), <tt>jih\u012br\u1e63a</tt>; <tt>bubh\u016br\u1e63a, mum\u016br\u1e63a</tt> (the only examples quotable).<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]}}}}
