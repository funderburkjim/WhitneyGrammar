The feminine stems of these adjectives are \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0947\u092f\u0938\u0940 <tt>\u00e7r\u00e9yas\u012b</tt> and \u0917\u0930\u0940\u092f\u0938\u0940 <tt>g\u00e1r\u012byas\u012b</tt>.\n\n485. a. The Vedic voc. masc.

No example of a middle case occurs in RV. or AV.\n\nc. In the later language are found a very few apparent examples of strong cases made from the weaker stem-form: thus, <tt>kan\u012byasam</tt> and <tt>yav\u012byasam</tt> acc. masc., <tt>kan\u012byas\u0101u</tt> du., <tt>yav\u012byasas</tt> nom. pl.\n\n<center>Comparison.</center>\n\n466. Derivative adjective stems having a comparative and superlative meaning \u2014 or often also (and more originally) a merely intensive value \u2014 are made either directly from roots (by primary derivation), or from other derivative or compound stems (by secondary derivation).\n\na. The subject of comparison belongs more properly to the chapter of derivation; but it stands in such near relation to inflection that it is, in accordance with the usual custom in grammars, conveniently and suitably enough treated briefly here. \n\n467. The suffixes of primary derivation are \u0908\u092f\u0938\u094d <tt>\u012byas</tt> (or \u0908\u092f\u093e\u0902\u0938\u094d <tt>\u012by\u0101\u1e45s</tt>) for the comparative and \u0907\u0937\u094d\u0920 <tt>i\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> for the superlative. The root before them is accented, and usually strengthened by gunating, if capable of it \u2014 or, in some cases, by nasalization or prolongation. They are much more frequently and freely used in the oldest language than later; in the classical Sanskrit, only a limited number of such comparatives and superlatives are accepted in use; and these attach themselves in meaning for the most part to other adjectives from the same root, which seem to be their corresponding positives; but in part also they are artificially connected with other words, unrelated with them in derivation. \n\na. Thus, from <tt>\u221ak\u1e63ip</tt> ''hurl'' come k\u1e63\u00e9p\u012byas and <tt>k\u1e63\u00e9pi\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt>, which belong in meaning to <tt>k\u1e63ipr\u00e1</tt> ''quick''; from <tt>\u221av\u1e5b</tt> ''encompass'' come <tt>v\u00e1r\u012byas</tt> and <tt>v\u00e1ri\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt>, which belong to <tt>ur\u00fa</tt> ''broad''; while, for example,<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"240844":{"pageid":240844,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/202","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><tt>k\u00e1n\u012byas</tt> and <tt>k\u00e1ni\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> are attached by the grammarians to <tt>y\u00favan</tt> ''young'', or <tt>\u00e1lpa</tt> ''small''; and <tt>v\u00e1r\u1e63\u012byas</tt> and <tt>v\u00e1r\u1e63i\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> to <tt>v\u1e5bddh\u00e1</tt> ''old''.\n\n468. From Veda and Br\u0101hma\u1e47a together, considerably more than a hundred instances of this primary formation in <tt>\u012byas</tt> and <tt>i\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> (in many cases only one of the pair actually occurring) are to be quoted. \n\na. About half of these (in RV., the decided majority) belong, in meaning as in form, to the bare root in its adjective value, as used especially at the end of compounds, but sometimes also independently: thus, from \u221a<tt>tap</tt> ''burn'' comes <tt>t\u00e1pi\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> ''excessively burning''; from \u221a<tt>yaj</tt> ''offer'' come <tt>y\u00e1j\u012byas</tt> and <tt>y\u00e1ji\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> ''better'' and ''best'' (or ''very well'') ''sacrificing''; from \u221a<tt>yudh</tt> ''fight'' comes <tt>y\u00f3dh\u012byas</tt> ''fighting better''; \u2014 in a few instances, the simple root is also found used as corresponding positive: thus, <tt>j\u016b\u0301</tt> ''hasty, rapid'' with <tt>j\u00e1v\u012byas</tt> and <tt>j\u00e1vi\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt>.\n\nb. In a little class of instances (eight), the root has a preposition prefixed, which then takes the accent: thus, <tt>\u0101\u0301gami\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> ''especially coming hither''; <tt>v\u00edcayi\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> ''best clearing away''; \u2014 in a couple of cases (<tt>\u00e1\u00e7rami\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt>, <tt>\u00e1par\u0101vapi\u1e63\u1e6da</tt>, <tt>\u00e1stheyas</tt>), the negative particle is prefixed; \u2014 in a single word (<tt>\u00e7\u00e1mbhavi\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt>), an element of another kind.\n\nc. The words of this formation sometimes take an accusative object (see 271 e).\n\nd. But even in the oldest language appears not infrequently the same attachment in meaning to a derivative adjective which (as pointed out above) is usual in the later speech.\n\ne. Besides the examples that occur also later, others are met with like <tt>v\u00e1ri\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> ''choicest'' (<tt>v\u00e1ra</tt> ''choice''), <tt>b\u00e1rhi\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> ''greatest'' (<tt>b\u1e5bh\u00e1nt</tt> ''great''), <tt>\u00f3\u1e63i\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> ''quickest'' (<tt>\u00f3\u1e63am</tt> ''quickly''), and so on.  Probably by analogy with these, like formations are in a few cases made from the apparently radical syllables of words which have no otherwise traceable root in the language: thus, <tt>kradh\u012byas</tt> and <tt>kradhi\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> (K.) from <tt>k\u1e5bdh\u00fa</tt>, <tt>sth\u00e1v\u012byas</tt> and <tt>sth\u00e1vi\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> from <tt>sth\u016br\u00e1</tt>, <tt>\u00e7\u00e1\u00e7\u012byas</tt> (RV.) from <tt>\u00e7\u00e1\u00e7vant</tt>, <tt>\u00e1\u1e47\u012byas</tt> (AV.) and <tt>\u00e1\u1e47i\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> (TS.) from <tt>a\u1e47\u00fa</tt>; and so on.  And yet again, in a few exceptional cases, the suffixes <tt>\u012byas</tt> and <tt>i\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> are applied to stems which are themselves palpably derivative: thus, <tt>\u0101\u0301\u00e7i\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> from <tt>\u0101\u00e7\u00fa</tt> (RV.: only case), <tt>t\u012b\u0301k\u1e63\u1e47\u012byas</tt> (AV.) from <tt>t\u012bk\u1e63\u1e47\u00e1</tt>, <tt>br\u00e1hm\u012byas</tt> and <tt>br\u00e1hmi\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> (TS. etc.) from <tt>br\u00e1hman</tt>, <tt>dh\u00e1rmi\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> (TA.) from <tt>dh\u00e1rman</tt>, <tt>dr\u00e1\u1e0dhi\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> (TA.: instead of <tt>d\u00e1rhi\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt>) from <tt>d\u1e5b\u1e0dh\u00e1</tt>, <tt>r\u00e1gh\u012byas</tt> (TS.) from <tt>raghu</tt>.  These are beginnings, not followed up later, of the extension of the formation to unlimited use.\n\nf. In <tt>n\u00e1v\u012byas</tt> or <tt>n\u00e1vyas</tt> and <tt>n\u00e1vi\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt>, from <tt>n\u00e1va</tt> ''new'', and in <tt>s\u00e1nyas</tt> from <tt>s\u00e1na</tt> ''old'' (all RV.), we have also formations unconnected with verbal roots.\n\n469. The stems in <tt>i\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> are inflected like ordinary adjectives in <tt>a</tt>, and make their feminines in <tt>\u0101</tt>; those in <tt>\u012byas</tt> have a peculiar declension, which has been described above (463 ff.).<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"240845":{"pageid":240845,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/203","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\n470. Of peculiarities and irregularities of formation, the following may be noticed:\n\na. The suffix <tt>\u012byas</tt> has in a few instances the briefer form <tt>yas</tt>, generally as alternative with the other: thus, <tt>t\u00e1v\u012byas</tt> and <tt>t\u00e1vyas</tt>, <tt>n\u00e1v\u012byas</tt> and <tt>n\u00e1vyas</tt>, <tt>v\u00e1s\u012byas</tt> and <tt>v\u00e1syas</tt>, <tt>p\u00e1n\u012byas</tt> and <tt>p\u00e1nyas</tt>; and so from <tt>rabh</tt> and <tt>sah</tt>; <tt>s\u00e1nyas</tt> occurs alone.  From <tt>bh\u016b</tt> come <tt>bh\u016b\u0301yas</tt> and <tt>bh\u016b\u0301yi\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt>, beside which RV. has also <tt>bh\u00e1v\u012byas</tt>.\n\nb. Of roots in <tt>\u0101</tt>, the final blends with the initial of the suffix to <tt>e</tt>: thus, <tt>sth\u00e9yas</tt>, <tt>dh\u00e9\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt>, <tt>y\u00e9\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt>; but such forms are in the Veda generally to be resolved, as <tt>dh\u00e1\u00ef\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt>, <tt>y\u00e1\u00ef\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt>.  The root <tt>jy\u0101</tt> forms <tt>jy\u00e9\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt>, but <tt>jy\u0101\u0301yas</tt> (like <tt>bh\u016b\u0301yas</tt>).\n\nc. The two roots in <tt>\u012b</tt>, <tt>pr\u012b</tt> and <tt>\u00e7r\u012b</tt>, form <tt>pr\u00e9yas</tt> and <tt>pr\u00e9\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> and <tt>\u00e7r\u00e9yas</tt> and <tt>\u00e7r\u00e9\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt>.\n\nd. From the root of <tt>\u1e5bj\u00fa</tt> come, without strengthening, <tt>\u1e5b\u0301j\u012byas</tt> and <tt>\u1e5b\u0301ji\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt>; but in the older language also, more regularly, <tt>r\u00e1j\u012byas</tt> and <tt>r\u00e1ji\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt>.\n\n471. The suffixes of secondary derivation are \u0924\u0930 <tt>tara</tt> and \u0924\u092e <tt>tama</tt>.  They are of almost unrestricted application, being added to adjectives of every form, simple and compound, ending in vowels or in consonants \u2014 and this from the earliest period of the language until the latest.  The accent of the primitive remains (with rare exceptions) unchanged; and that form of stem is generally taken which appears before an initial consonant of a case-ending (weak or middle form).\n\na. Examples (of older as well as later occurrence) are: from vowel-stems, <tt>priy\u00e1tara</tt>, <tt>v\u00e1hnitama</tt>, <tt>rath\u012b\u0301tara</tt> and <tt>rath\u012b\u0301tama</tt> (RV.), <tt>c\u0101\u0301rutara</tt>, <tt>pot\u1e5b\u0301tama</tt>, <tt>sa\u1e41raktatara</tt>; \u2014 from consonant-stems, <tt>\u00e7\u00e1\u1e41tama</tt>, <tt>\u00e7\u00e1\u00e7vattama</tt>, <tt>m\u1e5b\u1e0day\u00e1ttama</tt>, <tt>tav\u00e1stara</tt> and <tt>tav\u00e1stama</tt>, <tt>tuv\u00ed\u1e63\u1e6dama</tt>, <tt>v\u00e1pu\u1e63\u1e6dara</tt>, <tt>tapasv\u00edtara</tt>, <tt>ya\u00e7asv\u00edtama</tt>, <tt>bh\u00e1gavattara</tt>, <tt>hira\u1e47yav\u0101\u00e7\u012bmattama</tt>; \u2014 from compounds, <tt>ratnadh\u0101\u0301tama</tt>, <tt>abhibh\u016b\u0301tara</tt>, <tt>suk\u1e5b\u0301ttara</tt>, <tt>p\u016brbh\u00edttama</tt>, <tt>bh\u016byi\u1e63\u1e6dabh\u0101\u0301ktama</tt>, <tt>bh\u016brid\u0101\u0301vattara</tt>, <tt>\u00e7\u00facivratatama</tt>, <tt>str\u012bk\u0101matama</tt>.\n\nb. But in the Veda the final <tt>n</tt> of a stem is regularly retained; thus, <tt>mad\u00edntara</tt> and <tt>mad\u00edntama</tt>, <tt>v\u1e5b\u1e63\u00e1ntama</tt>; and a few stems even add a nasal: thus, <tt>surabh\u00edntara</tt>, <tt>ray\u00edntama</tt>, <tt>madh\u00fantama</tt>.  In a case or two, the strong stem of a present participle is taken: thus, <tt>vr\u0101\u0301dhanttama</tt>, <tt>s\u00e1hanttama</tt>; and, of a perfect participle, the weakest stem: thus, <tt>vid\u00fa\u1e63\u1e6dara</tt>, <tt>m\u012b\u1e0dh\u00fa\u1e63\u1e6dama</tt>.  A feminine final <tt>\u012b</tt> is shortened: thus, <tt>devitam\u0101</tt> (RV.), <tt>tejasvinitam\u0101</tt> (K.).<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"240846":{"pageid":240846,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/204","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\nc. In the older language, the words of this formation are not much more frequent than those of the other: thus, in RV. the stems in <tt>tara</tt> and <tt>tama</tt> are to those in <tt>\u012byas</tt> and <tt>i\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> as three to two; in AV., only as six to five: but later the former win a great preponderance.\n\n472. These comparatives and superlatives are inflected like ordinary adjectives in <tt>a</tt>, forming their feminine in <tt>\u0101</tt>.\n\n473. a. That (especially in the Veda) some stems which are nouns rather than adjectives form derivatives of comparison is natural enough, considering the uncertain nature of the division-line between substantive and adjective value.  Thus, we have <tt>v\u012br\u00e1tara</tt>, <tt>v\u012br\u00e1tama</tt>, <tt>v\u00e1hnitama</tt>, <tt>m\u0101t\u1e5b\u0301tama</tt>, <tt>n\u1e5b\u0301tama</tt>, <tt>mar\u00fattama</tt>, and so on.\n\nb. The suffixes <tt>tara</tt> and <tt>tama</tt> also make forms of comparison from some of the pronominal roots, as <tt>ka</tt>, <tt>ya</tt>, <tt>i</tt> (see below, 520); and from certain of the prepositions, as <tt>ud</tt>; and the adverbially used accusative (older, neuter, -<tt>taram</tt>; later, feminine, -<tt>tar\u0101m</tt>) of a comparative in <tt>tara</tt> from a preposition is employed to make a corresponding comparative to the preposition itself (below, 1119); while -<tt>tar\u0101m</tt> and -<tt>tam\u0101m</tt> make degrees of comparison from a few adverbs: thus, <tt>natar\u0101\u0301m</tt>, <tt>natam\u0101\u0301m</tt>, <tt>katha\u1e41tar\u0101m</tt>, <tt>kutastar\u0101m</tt>, <tt>addh\u0101tam\u0101\u0301m</tt>, <tt>n\u012bc\u0101istar\u0101m</tt>, etc.\n\nc. By a wholly barbarous combination, finding no warrant in the earlier and more genuine usages of the language, the suffixes of comparison in their adverbial feminine form, -<tt>tar\u0101m</tt> and -<tt>tam\u0101m</tt>, are later allowed to be added to personal forms of verbs: thus, <tt>s\u012bdatetar\u0101m</tt> (R.: the only case noted in the epics) ''is more despondent'', <tt>vyathayatitar\u0101m</tt> ''disturbs more'', <tt>alabhatatar\u0101m</tt> ''obtained in a higher degree'', <tt>hasi\u1e63yatitar\u0101m</tt> ''will laugh more''.  No examples of this use of -<tt>tam\u0101m</tt> are quotable.\n\nd. The suffixes of secondary comparison are not infrequently added to those of primary, forming double comparatives and superlatives: thus, <tt>gar\u012byastara</tt>, <tt>\u00e7re\u1e63\u1e6dhatara</tt> and <tt>\u00e7r\u00e9\u1e63\u1e6dhatama</tt>, <tt>p\u0101p\u012byastara</tt>, <tt>p\u0101pi\u1e63\u1e6dhatara</tt> and -<tt>tama</tt>, <tt>bh\u016byastaram</tt>, etc.\n\na. The use of <tt>tama</tt> as ordinal suffix is noted below (487); with this value, it is accented on the final, and makes its feminine in <tt>\u012b</tt>: thus, <tt>\u00e7atatam\u00e1</tt> m. n., <tt>\u00e7atatam\u012b\u0301</tt> f., ''hundredth''.\n\n474.  From a few words, mostly prepositions, degrees of comparison are made by the briefer suffixes <tt>ra</tt> and <tt>ma</tt>: thus, <tt>\u00e1dhara</tt> and <tt>adham\u00e1</tt>, <tt>\u00e1para</tt> and <tt>apam\u00e1</tt>, <tt>\u00e1vara</tt> and <tt>avam\u00e1</tt>, <tt>\u00fapara</tt> and <tt>upam\u00e1</tt>, <tt>\u00e1ntara</tt>, <tt>\u00e1ntama</tt>, <tt>param\u00e1</tt>, <tt>madhyam\u00e1</tt>, <tt>caram\u00e1</tt>, <tt>antima</tt>, <tt>\u0101dima</tt>, <tt>pa\u00e7cima</tt>.

In modern time, the only numbers in practical use above ''thousand'' are <tt>lak\u1e63a</tt> (''lac'' or ''lakh'') and <tt>ko\u1e6di</tt> (''crore''); and an Indian sum is wont to be pointed thus: 123,45,67,890, to signify ''123 crores, 45 lakhs, 67 thousand, eight hundred and ninety''. \n\ne. As to the alleged stem-forms <tt>pa\u00f1can</tt> etc., see below, 484. As to the form <tt>\u1e63ak\u1e63</tt> instead of <tt>\u1e63a\u1e63</tt>, see above, 146b. The stem <tt>dva</tt> appears in composition and derivation also as <tt>dv\u0101</tt> and <tt>dvi</tt>; <tt>cat\u00far</tt> in composition is accented <tt>c\u00e1tur</tt>. The older form of <tt>a\u1e63\u1e6da</tt> is <tt>a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101</tt>: see below, 483. Forms in -<tt>\u00e7at</tt> and -<tt>\u00e7ati</tt> for the tens are occasionally interchanged: e. g. <tt>vi\u1e45\u00e7at</tt> (MBh.

The numbers ''21\u201329'' are made like those for ''31\u201339''; the numbers ''41\u201349'', ''51\u201359'', ''71\u201379'', and ''91\u201399'' are made like those for ''61\u201369''. \n\nh. The forms made with <tt>dv\u0101</tt> and <tt>trayas</tt> are more usual than those with <tt>dvi</tt> and <tt>tri,</tt> which are hardly to be quoted from the older literature (V. and Br.). The forms made with <tt>a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101</tt> (instead of <tt>a\u1e63\u1e6da</tt>) are alone found in the older literature (483), and are usual in the later. \n\n477. The above are the normal expressions for the odd numbers. But equivalent substitutes for them are also variously made. Thus: \n\na. By use of the adjectives <tt>\u016bna</tt> ''deficient'' and <tt>adhika</tt> ''redundant'', in composition with lesser numbers which are to be subtracted or added, and either independently qualifying or (more usually) in composition with larger numbers which are to be increased or diminished by the others: thus, <tt>try\u016bna\u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6di\u1e25</tt> ''sixty deficient by three'' (i. e. ''57''); <tt>a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhikanavati\u1e25</tt> ''ninety increased by eight'' (i. e. ''98''); <tt>ek\u0101dhika\u1e41 \u00e7atam</tt> ''a hundred increased by one'' (i. e. ''101''); <tt>pa\u00f1cona\u1e41 \u00e7atam</tt> ''100 less 5'' (i. e. ''95''). For the nines, especially, such substitutes as <tt>ekonavi\u1e45\u00e7ati\u1e25</tt> ''20 less 1'', or ''19'', are not uncommon; and later the <tt>eka</tt> ''1'' is left off, and <tt>\u016bnavi\u1e45\u00e7ati</tt> etc. have the same value. \n\nb. A case-form of a smaller number, generally <tt>\u00e9ka</tt> ''one'' is connected by <tt>n\u00e1</tt> ''not'' with a larger number from which it is to be deducted: thus, <tt>\u00e9kay\u0101 n\u00e1 tri\u1e45\u00e7\u00e1t</tt> (\u00c7B. PB. KB.) ''not thirty by one'' (''29''); <tt>dv\u0101bhy\u0101\u1e41 n\u00e1 \u2019\u00e7\u012bt\u00edm</tt> (\u00c7B.)

This last form is admitted also in the later language; the others are found in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as. \n\nc. Instances of multiplication by a prefixed number are occasionally met with: thus, <tt>tri\u1e63apt\u00e1</tt> ''thrice seven''; <tt>tri\u1e47av\u00e1</tt> ''thrice nine''; <tt>trida\u00e7\u00e1</tt> ''thrice ten''. \n\nd. Of course, the numbers to be added together may be expressed by independent words, with connecting ''and'': thus, <tt>n\u00e1va ca navat\u00ed\u00e7 ca</tt>, or <tt>n\u00e1va navat\u00ed\u00e7 ca</tt> ''ninety and nine''; <tt>dv\u0101\u00fa ca vi\u1e45\u00e7at\u00ed\u00e7 ca</tt> ''two and twenty''. But the connective is also (at least, in the older language) not seldom omitted: thus, <tt>navat\u00edr n\u00e1va</tt> ''99''; <tt>tri\u1e45\u00e7\u00e1ta\u1e41 tr\u012b\u0301n</tt> ''33''; <tt>a\u00e7\u012bt\u00edr a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u00fa</tt> ''88''. \n\n478. The same methods are also variously used for forming the odd numbers above 100. Thus: \n\na. The added number is prefixed to the other, and takes the accent: for example, <tt>\u00e9ka\u00e7atam</tt> ''101''; <tt>a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u00e7atam</tt> ''108''; <tt>tri\u1e45\u00e7\u00e1cchatam</tt> ''130''; <tt>a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101vi\u1e45\u00e7ati\u00e7atam</tt> ''128''; <tt>c\u00e1tu\u1e25sahasram</tt> (RV.: unless the accent is wrong) ''1004''; <tt>a\u00e7\u012btisahasram</tt> ''1080''.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"390472":{"pageid":390472,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/208","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\nb. Or, the number to be added is compounded with <tt>adhika</tt> ''redundant'', and the compound is either made to qualify the other number or is further compounded with it: thus, <tt>pa\u00f1c\u0101dhika\u1e41 \u00e7atam</tt> or <tt>pa\u00f1c\u0101dhika\u00e7atam</tt> ''105''. Of course, <tt>\u016bna</tt> ''deficient'' (as also other words equivalent to <tt>\u016bna</tt> or <tt>adhika</tt>) may be used in the same way: thus, <tt>pa\u00f1cona\u1e41 \u00e7atam</tt> 95, <tt>\u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6di\u1e25 pa\u00f1cavarjit\u0101</tt> ''55''; <tt>\u00e7atam abhyadhika\u1e41 \u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6dita\u1e25</tt> ''160''. \n\nc. Syntactical combinations are made at convenience: for example, <tt>d\u00e1\u00e7a \u00e7at\u00e1\u1e41 ca</tt> ''110''; <tt>\u00e7at\u00e1m \u00e9ka\u1e41 ca</tt> ''101''. \n\n479. Another usual method (beginning in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as) of forming the odd numbers above 100 is to qualify the larger number by an adjective derived from the smaller, and identical with the briefer ordinal (below, 487): thus, <tt>dv\u0101da\u00e7\u00e1\u1e41 \u00e7at\u00e1m</tt>, ''112'' (lit'ly ''a hundred of a 12-sort'', or ''characterised by 12''); <tt>catu\u00e7catv\u0101ri\u1e45\u00e7\u00e1\u1e41 \u00e7at\u00e1m</tt> ''144''; <tt>\u1e63a\u1e6d\u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6d\u00e1\u1e41 \u00e7at\u00e1m</tt> ''166''.\n\n480. To multiply one number by another, among the higher or the lower denominations, the simplest and least ambiguous method is to make of the multiplied number a dual or plural, qualified by the other as any ordinary noun would be; and this method is a common one in all ages of the language. For example: <tt>p\u00e1\u00f1ca pa\u00f1c\u0101\u00e7\u00e1tas</tt> ''five fifties'' (''250''); <tt>n\u00e1va navat\u00e1yas</tt> ''nine nineties'' (''810''); <tt>a\u00e7\u012bt\u00edbhis tis\u1e5b\u0301bhis</tt> ''with three eighties'' (''240''); <tt>p\u00e1\u00f1ca \u00e7at\u0101\u0301ni</tt> ''five hundreds''; <tt>tr\u012b\u0301\u1e47i sah\u00e1sr\u0101\u1e47i</tt> ''three thousands''; <tt>\u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6d\u00ed\u1e41 sah\u00e1sr\u0101\u1e47i</tt> ''60,000''; <tt>da\u00e7a ca sahasr\u0101\u1e47y a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101u ca \u00e7at\u0101ni</tt> ''10,800'': and, combined with addition, <tt>tr\u012b\u0301\u1e47i \u00e7at\u0101\u0301ni tr\u00e1yastri\u1e45\u00e7ata\u1e41 ca</tt> ''333''; <tt>sahasre dve pa\u00f1cona\u1e41 \u00e7atam eva ca</tt> ''2095''. \n\na. In an exceptional case or two, the ordinal form appears to take the place of the cardinal as multiplicand in a like combination: thus, <tt>\u1e63a\u1e6dtri\u1e45\u00e7\u0101\u0301\u1e45\u00e7 ca cat\u00fara\u1e25</tt> (RV.) ''36x4'' (lit. four of the thirty-six kind); <tt>tr\u012b\u0301\u1e45r ek\u0101da\u00e7\u0101\u0301n</tt> (RV.) or <tt>traya ek\u0101da\u00e7\u0101sa\u1e25</tt> (\u00c7\u00c7S. viii. 21. 1) ''11x3''. \n\nb. By a peculiar and wholly illogical construction, such a combination as <tt>tr\u012b\u1e47i \u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6di\u00e7at\u0101ni</tt>, which ought to signify ''480'' (''3x<span style=\"text-decoration: overline\">100+60</span>''), is repeatedly used in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as to mean ''360'' (''3x100+60''); so also <tt>dv\u00e9 catustri\u1e45\u00e7\u00e9 \u00e7at\u00e9</tt> ''234'' (not ''268''); <tt>dv\u0101\u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101ni tr\u012b\u1e47i \u00e7at\u0101ni</tt> ''362''; and other like cases. And even R. has <tt>traya\u1e25 \u00e7ata\u00e7at\u0101rdh\u0101\u1e25</tt> ''350''. \n\n481. But the two factors, multiplier and multiplied, are also, and in later usage more generally, combined into a compound (accented on the final); and this is then treated as an adjective, qualifying the numbered noun; or else its neuter or feminine (in <tt>\u012b</tt>) singular is used substantively: thus, <tt>da\u00e7a\u00e7at\u0101\u0301s</tt> ''1000''; <tt>\u1e63a\u1e6d\u00e7at\u0101i\u1e25 pad\u0101tibhi\u1e25</tt> (MBh.) ''with 600 foot-soldiers''; <tt>tr\u00e1yastri\u1e45\u00e7at tri\u00e7at\u0101\u0301\u1e25 \u1e63a\u1e6dsahasr\u0101\u1e25</tt> (AV.) ''6333''; <tt>dvi\u00e7at\u00e1m</tt> or <tt>dvi\u00e7at\u012b\u0301</tt> ''200''; <tt>a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101da\u00e7a\u00e7at\u012b</tt> ''1800''. \n\na. In the usual absence of accentuation, there arises sometimes a question as to how a compound number shall be understood: whether <tt>a\u1e63\u1e6da\u00e7atam</tt>, for example, is <tt>a\u1e63\u1e6d\u00e1\u00e7atam</tt> ''108'' or <tt>a\u1e63\u1e6da\u00e7at\u00e1m</tt> ''800'', and the like.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"390473":{"pageid":390473,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/209","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\n482. Inflection. The inflection of the cardinal numerals is in many respects irregular. Gender is distinguished only by the first four. \n\na. <tt>Eka</tt> ''one'' is declined after the manner of a pronominal adjective (like <tt>s\u00e1rva</tt>, below, 524); its plural is used in the sense of ''some, certain ones''. Its dual does not occur. \n\nb. Occasional forms of the ordinary declension are met with: thus, <tt>\u00e9ke</tt> (loc. sing.), <tt>\u00e9k\u0101t</tt> (477 b). \n\nc. In the late literature, <tt>eka</tt> is used in the sense of ''a certain'', or even sometimes almost of ''a'', as an indefinite article. Thus, <tt>eko vy\u0101ghra\u1e25</tt> (H.) ''a certain tiger''; <tt>ekasmin dine</tt> ''on a certain day''; <tt>haste da\u1e47\u1e0dam ekam \u0101d\u0101ya</tt> (H.) ''taking a stick in his hand''. \n\nd. <tt>Dva</tt> ''two'' is dual only, and is entirely regular: thus, N. A. V. <tt>dv\u0101\u00fa</tt> (<tt>dv\u0101\u0301</tt>, Veda) m., <tt>dv\u00e9</tt> f. n.; I. D. Ab. <tt>dv\u0101\u0301bhy\u0101m</tt>; G. L. <tt>dv\u00e1yos</tt>. \n\ne. <tt>Tri</tt> ''three'' is in masc. and neut. nearly regular, like an ordinary stem in <tt>i</tt>; but the genitive is as if from <tt>tray\u00e1</tt> (only in the later language: the regular <tt>tr\u012b\u1e47\u0101\u0301m</tt> occurs once in RV.). For the feminine it has the peculiar stem <tt>tis\u1e5b\u0301</tt>, which is inflected in general like an <tt>\u1e5b</tt>-stem; but the nom. and accus. are alike, and show no strengthening of the <tt>\u1e5b</tt>; and the <tt>\u1e5b</tt> is not prolonged in the gen. (excepting in the Veda).

The use of <tt>n</tt> before <tt>\u0101m</tt> of the gen. masc. and neut. after a final consonant of the stem is (as in <tt>\u1e63a\u1e63</tt>: below, 483) a striking irregularity. The more regular gen. fem. <tt>catas\u1e5d\u1e47\u0101m</tt> also sometimes occurs. In the later language, the accentuation of the final syllable instead of the penult is said to be allowed in inst., dat.-abl., and loc. \n\n483. The numbers from ''5'' to ''19'' have no distinction of gender, nor any generic character. They are inflected, somewhat irregularly, as plurals, save in the nom.-acc., where they have no proper plural form, but show the bare stem instead. Of <tt>\u1e63\u00e1\u1e63</tt> (as of <tt>cat\u00far</tt>), <tt>n\u0101m</tt> is the gen. ending, with mutual assimilation (198 b) of stem-final and initial of the termination. <tt>A\u1e63\u1e6d\u00e1</tt> (as accented in the older language) has an alternative fuller form, <tt>a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u0301</tt>, which is almost exclusively used in the older literature (V. and B), both in inflection and in composition (but some compounds with <tt>a\u1e63\u1e6da</tt> are found as early as the AV.); its nom.-acc. is <tt>a\u1e63\u1e6d\u00e1</tt> (usual later: found in RV. once, and in AV.), or <tt>a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u0301</tt> (RV.), or <tt>a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u00fa</tt> (most usual in RV.; also in AV., B., and later). \n\na. The accent is in many respects peculiar. In all the accented texts, the stress of voice lies on the penult before the endings <tt>bhis, bhyas</tt>, and <tt>su</tt>, from the stems in <tt>a</tt>, whatever be the accent of the stem: thus, <tt>pa\u00f1c\u00e1bhis</tt> from <tt>p\u00e1\u00f1ca, nav\u00e1bhyas</tt> from <tt>n\u00e1va, da\u00e7\u00e1su</tt> from <tt>d\u00e1\u00e7a, navada\u00e7\u00e1bhis</tt> from <tt>n\u00e1vada\u00e7a, ek\u0101da\u00e7\u00e1bhyas</tt> from <tt>\u00e9k\u0101da\u00e7a, dv\u0101da\u00e7\u00e1su</tt> from <tt>dv\u0101\u0301da\u00e7a</tt> (according to the grammarians, either the penult or the final is accented in these forms in the later language). In the gen. pl., the accent is on the ending (as in that of <tt>i-, u-</tt>, and <tt>\u1e5b</tt>-sterns): thus, <tt>pa\u00f1cada\u00e7\u0101n\u0101\u0301m, saptada\u00e7\u0101n\u0101\u0301m</tt>. The cases of <tt>\u1e63a\u1e63</tt>, and those made from the stem-form <tt>a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101</tt>, have the accent throughout upon the ending. \n\nb.

The like is true of the higher numbers \u2014 which have, indeed, no proper numeral character, but are ordinary nouns. \n\n486. Construction. As regards their construction with the nouns enumerated by them \u2014\n\na. The words for 1 to 19 are in the main used adjectively, agreeing in case, and, if they distinguish gender, in gender also, with the nouns: thus, <tt>da\u00e7\u00e1bhir v\u012br\u0101\u00ed\u1e25</tt> ''with ten heroes''; <tt>y\u00e9 dev\u0101\u0301 divy \u00e9k\u0101da\u00e7a sth\u00e1</tt> (AV.)

Rarely occur such combinations as <tt>d\u00e1\u00e7a kal\u00e1\u00e7\u0101n\u0101m</tt> (RV.) ''ten pitchers'', <tt>\u1e5bt\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 \u1e63a\u1e6d</tt> (R.) ''six seasons''. \n\nb. The numerals above ''19'' are construed usually as nouns, either taking the numbered noun as a dependent genitive, or standing in the singular in apposition with it: thus, <tt>\u00e7ata\u1e41 d\u0101s\u012b\u1e25</tt> or <tt>\u00e7ata\u1e41 d\u0101s\u012bn\u0101m</tt> ''a hundred slaves'' or ''a hundred of slaves''; <tt>vi\u1e45\u00e7aty\u0101\u0301 h\u00e1ribhi\u1e25</tt> ''with twenty bays''; <tt>\u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6dy\u0101\u0301\u1e41 \u00e7ar\u00e1t\u1e63u</tt> ''in 60 autumns''; <tt>\u00e7at\u00e9na p\u0101\u0301\u00e7\u0101i\u1e25</tt> ''with a hundred fetters''; <tt>\u00e7at\u00e1\u1e41 sah\u00e1sram ay\u00fata\u1e41 ny\u00e0rbuda\u1e41 jagh\u0101\u0301na \u00e7akr\u00f3 d\u00e1sy\u016bn\u0101m</tt> (AV.)

In the older language, the numerals for 5 and upward are sometimes used in the nom.-acc. form (or as if indeclinably) with other cases also: thus, <tt>p\u00e1\u00f1ca k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u00ed\u1e63u</tt> ''among the five races''; <tt>sapt\u00e1 r\u1e63\u012b\u1e47\u0101m</tt> ''of seven bards''; <tt>sah\u00e1sram \u1e5b\u0301\u1e63ibhi\u1e25</tt> ''with a thousand bards''; <tt>\u00e7at\u00e1m p\u016brbh\u00ed\u1e25</tt> ''with a hundred strongholds''. Sporadic instances of a like kind are also met with later. \n\n487. Ordinals.

The briefer second forms for accus., dat., and gen., in all numbers, are accentless; and hence they are not allowed to stand at the beginning of a sentence, or elsewhere where any emphasis is laid. \n\nc. But they may be qualified by accented adjuncts, as adjectives: e. g. <tt>te j\u00e1yata\u1e25</tt> ''of thee when a conqueror'', <tt>vo v\u1e5bt\u0101\u0301bhya\u1e25</tt> ''for you that were confined'', <tt>nas tribhy\u00e1\u1e25</tt> ''to us three'' (all RV.). \n\nd. The ablative <tt>mat</tt> is accentless in one or two AV. passages. \n\n492. Forms of the older language. All the forms given above are found also in the older language; which, however, has also others that afterward disappear from use. \n\na. Thus, we find a few times the instr. sing. <tt>tv\u0101\u0301</tt> (only RV.: like <tt>man\u012b\u1e63\u0101\u0301</tt> for <tt>man\u012b\u1e63\u00e1y\u0101</tt>); further, the loc. or dat. sing. <tt>m\u00e9</tt> (only VS.) and <tt>tv\u00e9</tt>, and the dat. or loc. pl. <tt>asm\u00e9</tt> (which is by far the commonest of these <tt>e</tt>-forms) and <tt>yu\u1e63m\u00e9</tt>: their final <tt>e</tt> is uncombinable (or <tt>prag\u1e5bhya</tt>: 138 b). The VS. makes twice the acc. pl. fem. <tt>yu\u1e63m\u0101\u0301s</tt> (as if <tt>yu\u1e63m\u0101\u0301n</tt> were too distinctively a masculine form). The datives in <tt>bhyam</tt> are in a number of cases written, and in yet others to be read as if written, with <tt>bhya</tt>, with loss of the final nasal; and in a rare instance or two we have in like manner <tt>asm\u0101\u0301ka</tt> and <tt>yu\u1e63m\u0101\u0301ka</tt> in the gen. plural. The usual resolutions of semivowel to vowel are made, and are especially frequent in the forms of the second person (<tt>tu\u00e1m</tt> for <tt>tv\u00e1m</tt> etc.). \n\nb. But the duals, above all, wear a very different aspect earlier. In Veda and <tt>Br\u0101hma\u1e47a</tt> and <tt>S\u016btra</tt> the nominatives are (with occasional exceptions) avam and yuvam, and only the accusatives <tt>\u0101v\u0101\u0301m</tt> and <tt>yuv\u0101\u0301m</tt> (but in RV. the dual forms of 1st pers. chance not to occur, unless in <tt>v\u0101\u0301m</tt>[?], once, for <tt>\u0101v\u00e1m</tt>); the instr. in RV. is either <tt>yuv\u0101\u0301bhy\u0101m</tt> (occurs also once in A\u00c7S.) or <tt>yuv\u0101bhy\u0101m</tt>; an abl. <tt>yuv\u00e1t</tt> appears once in RV., and <tt>\u0101v\u00e1t</tt> twice in TS.; the gen.-loc. is in RV. (only) <tt>yuv\u00f3s</tt> instead of <tt>yuv\u00e1yos</tt>. Thus we have here a distinction (elsewhere unknown) of five different dual cases, by endings in part accordant with those of the other two numbers. \n\n493. Peculiar endings. The ending <tt>am</tt>, appearing in the nom. sing. and pl. (and Vedic du.) of these pronouns, will be found often, though only in sing., among the other pronouns. The <tt>bhyam</tt> (or <tt>hyam</tt>) of dat. sing. and pl. is met with only here; its relationship with the <tt>bhy\u0101m, bhyas, bhis</tt> of the ordinary declension is palpable.

That the nom., dat., and abl. endings should be the same in sing. and pl. (and in part in the earlier du. also), only the stem to which they are added being different, is unparalleled elsewhere in the language. The element <tt>sma</tt> appearing in the plural forms will be found frequent in the inflection of the singular in other pronominal words: in fact, the compound stem <tt>asma</tt> which underlies the plural of <tt>aham</tt> seems to be the same that furnishes part of the singular forms of <tt>ayam</tt> (501), and its value of ''we'' to be a specialisation of the meaning ''these persons''. The genitives singular, <tt>m\u00e1ma</tt> and <tt>t\u00e1va</tt>, have no analogies elsewhere; the derivation from them of the adjectives <tt>m\u0101maka</tt> and <tt>t\u0101vaka</tt> (below, 516 a) suggests the possibility of their being themselves stereotyped stems. The gen. pl., <tt>asm\u0101\u0301kam</tt> and <tt>yu\u1e63m\u0101\u0301kam</tt>, are certainly of this character: namely, neuter sing. case-forms of the adjective stems <tt>asm\u0101ka</tt> and <tt>yu\u1e63m\u0101ka</tt>, other cases of which are found in the Veda. \n\n494. Stem-forms. To the Hindu grammarians, the stems of the personal pronouns are <tt>mad</tt> and <tt>asmad</tt>, and <tt>tvad</tt> and <tt>yu\u1e63mad</tt>, because these are forms used to a certain extent, and allowed to be indefinitely used, in derivation and composition (like <tt>tad</tt>, <tt>kad</tt>, etc.: see below, under the other pronouns). Words are thus formed from them even in the older language \u2014 namely, <tt>m\u00e1tk\u1e5bta</tt> and <tt>m\u00e1tsakhi</tt> and <tt>asm\u00e1tsakhi</tt> (RV.), <tt>tv\u00e1dyoni</tt> and <tt>matt\u00e1s</tt> (AV.), <tt>tv\u00e1tpit\u1e5b</tt> and <tt>tv\u00e1dviv\u0101cana</tt> (TS.), <tt>tv\u00e1tpras\u016bta</tt> and <tt>tvaddevaty\u00e0</tt> and <tt>yuvaddevaty\u00e0</tt> and <tt>yu\u1e63maddevaty\u00e0</tt> (\u00c7B.), <tt>asmaddevatya</tt> (PB.); but much more numerous are those that show the proper stem in <tt>a</tt>, or with the <tt>a</tt> lengthened to <tt>\u0101</tt>: thus, <tt>m\u0101\u0301vant</tt>; <tt>asmatr\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>asmadr\u00fah</tt>, etc.; <tt>tv\u00e1yata</tt>, <tt>tv\u0101\u0301vant</tt>, <tt>tv\u0101\u0301datta</tt>, <tt>tv\u0101n\u00edd</tt>, <tt>tv\u0101\u0301vasu</tt>, <tt>tv\u0101\u0301hata</tt>, etc.; <tt>yu\u1e63m\u0101\u0301datta</tt>, <tt>yu\u1e63m\u00e9\u1e63ita</tt>, etc.; <tt>yuv\u0101\u0301vant</tt>, <tt>yuv\u0101\u0301ku</tt>, <tt>yuv\u00e1dhita</tt>, <tt>yuv\u0101\u0301datta</tt>, <tt>yuv\u0101\u0301n\u012bta</tt>, etc. And the later language also has a few words made in the same way, as <tt>m\u0101d\u1e5b\u00e7</tt>. \n\na. The Vedas have certain more irregular combinations, with complete forms: thus, <tt>tv\u0101\u0301\u1e41k\u0101ma</tt>, <tt>tv\u0101m\u0101huti</tt>, <tt>m\u0101mpa\u00e7y\u00e1</tt>, <tt>mamasaty\u00e1</tt>, <tt>asm\u00e9hiti</tt>, <tt>ahamp\u016brv\u00e1</tt>, <tt>ahamuttar\u00e1</tt>, <tt>aha\u1e41y\u00fa</tt>, <tt>aha\u1e41sana</tt>. \n\nb. From the stems of the grammarians come also the derivative adjectives <tt>mad\u012b\u0301ya</tt>, <tt>tvad\u012b\u0301ya</tt>, <tt>asmad\u012b\u0301ya</tt> <tt>yu\u1e63mad\u012b\u0301ya</tt>, having a possessive value: see below, 516. \n\nc.

The Vedas show no other irregularities of inflection than those which belong to all stems in <tt>a</tt> and <tt>\u0101</tt>: namely, <tt>t\u00e9n\u0101</tt> sometimes; usually <tt>t\u0101\u0301</tt> for <tt>t\u0101\u00fa</tt>, du.; often <tt>t\u0101\u0301</tt> for <tt>t\u0101\u0301ni</tt>, pl. neut.; usually <tt>t\u00e9bhis</tt> for <tt>t\u0101\u00eds</tt>, instr. pl.; and the ordinary resolutions. The RV. has one more case-form from the root <tt>sa</tt>, namely <tt>s\u00e1smin</tt> (occurring nearly half as often as <tt>t\u00e1smin</tt>); and ChU. has once <tt>sasm\u0101t</tt>. \n\n496. The peculiarities of the general pronominal declension, it will be noticed, are these: \n\na. In the singular, the use of <tt>t</tt> (properly <tt>d</tt>) as ending of nom.-acc. neut.; the combination of another element <tt>sma</tt> with the root in masc. and neut. dat., abl., and loc., and of <tt>sy</tt> in fem. dat, abl.-gen., and loc.; and the masc. and neut. loc. ending <tt>in</tt>, which is restricted to this declension (except in the anomalous <tt>y\u0101d\u1e5b\u0301\u00e7min</tt>, RV., once). The substitution in B. of <tt>\u0101i</tt> for <tt>\u0101s</tt> as fem. ending (307 h) was illustrated at 365 d. \n\nb. The dual is precisely that of noun-stems in <tt>a</tt> and <tt>\u0101</tt>. \n\nc. In the plural, the irregularities are limited to <tt>t\u00e9</tt> for <tt>t\u0101\u0301s</tt> in nom. masc., and the insertion of <tt>s</tt> instead of <tt>n</tt> before <tt>\u0101m</tt> of the gen., the stem-final being treated before it in the same manner as before <tt>su</tt> of the loc. \n\n497. The stem of this pronoun is by the grammarians given as <tt>tad</tt>; and from that form come, in fact, the derivative adjective <tt>tad\u012b\u0301ya</tt>, with <tt>tattv\u00e1, tadvat, tanmaya</tt>; and numerous compounds, such as <tt>tacch\u012bla, tajj\u00f1a, tatkara, tadanantara, tanm\u0101tra</tt>, etc. These compounds are not rare even in the Veda: so <tt>t\u00e1danna, tadv\u00edd, tadva\u00e7\u00e1</tt>, etc. But derivatives from the true root <tt>ta</tt> are also many: especially adverbs, as <tt>t\u00e1tas, t\u00e1tra, t\u00e1th\u0101, tad\u0101\u0301</tt>; the adjectives <tt>t\u0101\u0301vant</tt> and <tt>t\u00e1ti</tt>; and the compound <tt>t\u0101d\u1e5b\u0301\u00e7</tt> etc. \n\n498. Though the demonstrative root <tt>ta</tt> is prevailingly of the third person, it is also freely used, both in the earlier language and in the later, as qualifying the pronouns of the first and second person, giving emphasis to them: thus, <tt>s\u00f2 \u2018h\u00e1m</tt>, ''this I'', or ''I here''; <tt>s\u00e1</tt> or <tt>s\u0101\u0301 tv\u00e1m</tt> ''thou there''; <tt>te vayam</tt>, ''we here''; <tt>tasya mama</tt> ''of me here'', <tt>tasmi\u1e45s tvayi</tt> ''in thee there'', and so on. \n\n499. Two other demonstrative stems appear to contain <tt>ta</tt> as an element; and both, like the simple <tt>ta</tt>, substitute <tt>sa</tt> in the nom. sing. masc. and fem.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"390529":{"pageid":390529,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/219","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\na. The one, <tt>tya</tt>, is tolerably common (although only a third of its possible forms occur) in RV., but rare in AV., and almost unknown later, its nom. sing., in the three genders, is <tt>sy\u00e1s, sy\u0101\u0301, ty\u00e1t</tt>, and it makes the accusatives <tt>ty\u00e1m, ty\u0101\u0301m, ty\u00e1t</tt>, and goes on through the remaining cases in the same manner as <tt>ta</tt>. It has in RV. the instr. fem. <tt>ty\u0101\u0301</tt> (for <tt>ty\u00e1y\u0101</tt>). Instead of <tt>sy\u0101</tt> as nom. sing. fem. is also found <tt>ty\u0101</tt>. \n\nb. The other is the usual demonstrative of nearer position, ''this here'', and is in frequent use through all periods of the language. It prefixes <tt>e</tt> to the simple root, forming the nominatives <tt>e\u1e63\u00e1s, e\u1e63\u0101\u0301, et\u00e1t</tt> \u2014 and so on through the whole inflection. \n\nc. The stem <tt>tya</tt> has neither compounds nor derivatives. But from <tt>eta</tt> are formed both, in the same manner as from the simple <tt>ta</tt>, only much less numerous: thus, <tt>etadd\u0101\u0301</tt> (\u00c7B.), <tt>etadartha</tt>, etc., from the so-called stem <tt>etat</tt>; and <tt>et\u0101d\u1e5b\u0301\u00e7</tt> and <tt>et\u0101\u0301vant</tt> from <tt>eta</tt>. And <tt>e\u1e63a</tt>, like <tt>sa</tt> (498), is used to qualify pronouns of the 1st and 2d persons: e. g. <tt>e\u1e63\u0101 \u2019ham, ete vayam</tt>.\n\n500. There is a defective pronominal stem, <tt>ena</tt>, which is accentless, and hence used only in situations where no emphasis falls upon it. It does not occur elsewhere than in the accusative of all numbers, the instr. sing., and the gen.-loc. dual: thus, \n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n! || || m. || n. || f. \n|-\n! Sing. \n!

A.\n|| en\u0101n|| en\u0101ni ||en\u0101s \n|}\n\na. The RV. has <tt>enos</tt> instead of <tt>enayos</tt>, and in one or two instances accents a form: thus, <tt>en\u0101\u0301m, en\u0101\u0301s</tt> (?). AB. uses <tt>enat</tt> also as nom. neut. \n\nb. As <tt>ena</tt> is always used substantively, it has more nearly than <tt>ta</tt> the value of a third personal pronoun, unemphatic. Apparent examples of its adjectival use here and there met with are doubtless the result of confusion with <tt>eta</tt> (499 b). \n\nc. This stem forms neither derivatives nor compounds. \n\n501. The declension of two other demonstratives is so irregularly made up that they have to be given in full. The one, \u0905\u092f\u092e\u094d <tt>ay\u00e1m</tt> etc., is used as a more indefinite demonstrative, ''this'' or ''that''; the other, \u0905\u0938\u094c <tt>as\u0101\u00fa</tt> etc., signifies especially the remoter relation, ''yon'' or ''yonder''. \n\na. They are as follows:<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"390530":{"pageid":390530,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/221","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\nb. The same forms are used in the older language, without variation, except that (as usual) <tt>im\u0101\u0301</tt> occurs for <tt>im\u0101\u00fa</tt> and <tt>im\u0101\u0301ni</tt>, and <tt>am\u016b\u0301</tt> for <tt>am\u016b\u0301ni</tt>; <tt>amuy\u0101</tt> when used adverbially is accented on the final, <tt>amuy\u0101\u0301</tt>; <tt>as\u0101u</tt> (with accent, of course, on the first, <tt>\u00e1s\u0101u</tt>; or without accent, <tt>as\u0101u</tt>: 314) is used also as vocative; <tt>am\u012b</tt>, too, occurs as vocative. \n\n502. a. The former of these two pronouns, <tt>ay\u00e1m</tt> etc., plainly shows itself to be pieced together from a number of defective stems. The majority of forms come from the root <tt>a</tt>, with which, as in the ordinary pronominal declension, <tt>sma</tt> (f. <tt>sy</tt>) is combined in the singular. All these forms from <tt>a</tt> have the peculiarity that in their substantive use they are either accented, as in the paradigm, or accentless (like <tt>ena</tt> and the second forms from <tt>ah\u00e1m</tt> and <tt>tv\u00e1m</tt>). The remaining forms are always accented. From <tt>an\u00e1</tt> come, with entire regularity, <tt>an\u00e9na</tt>, <tt>an\u00e1y\u0101</tt>, <tt>an\u00e1yos</tt>. The strong cases in dual and plural, and in part in singular, come not less regularly from a stem <tt>im\u00e1</tt>. And <tt>ay\u00e1m</tt>, <tt>iy\u00e1m</tt>, <tt>id\u00e1m</tt> are evidently to be referred to a simple root <tt>i</tt> (<tt>id\u00e1m</tt> being apparently a double form: <tt>id</tt>, like <tt>tad</tt> etc., with ending <tt>am</tt>). \n\nb. The Veda has from the root <tt>a</tt> also the instrumental <tt>en\u0101\u0301</tt> and <tt>ay\u0101\u0301</tt> (used in general adverbially), and the gen. loc. du. <tt>ay\u00f3s</tt>; from <tt>ima</tt>, <tt>im\u00e1sya</tt> occurs once in RV., <tt>imasm\u0101i</tt> in AA., and <tt>im\u0101is</tt> and <tt>ime\u1e63u</tt> later. The RV. has in a small number of instances the irregular accentuation <tt>\u00e1sm\u0101i</tt>, <tt>\u00e1sya</tt>, <tt>\u0101\u0301bhis</tt>. \n\nc. In analogy with the other pronouns, <tt>id\u00e1m</tt> is by the grammarians regarded as representative stem of this pronominal declension; and it is actually found so treated in a very small number of compounds (<tt>idamm\u00e1ya</tt> and <tt>id\u00e1\u1e41r\u016bpa</tt> are of Br\u0101hma\u1e47a age). As regards the actual stems, <tt>ana</tt> furnishes nothing further; from <tt>ima</tt> comes only the adverb <tt>im\u00e1th\u0101</tt> (RV., once); but <tt>a</tt> and <tt>i</tt> furnish a number of derivatives, mostly adverbial: thus, for example, <tt>\u00e1tas</tt>, <tt>\u00e1tra</tt>, <tt>\u00e1tha</tt>, <tt>ad-dh\u0101\u0301</tt>(?); <tt>it\u00e1s</tt>, <tt>\u00edd</tt> (Vedic particle), <tt>id\u0101</tt>, <tt>ih\u00e1</tt>, <tt>\u00edtara</tt>, <tt>\u012bm</tt> (Vedic particle), <tt>\u012bd\u1e5b\u0301\u00e7</tt>, perhaps <tt>ev\u00e1</tt> and <tt>ev\u00e1m</tt>, and others. \n\n503. The other pronoun, <tt>as\u0101\u00fa</tt> etc., has <tt>am\u00fa</tt> for its leading stem, which in the singular takes in combination, like the <tt>a</tt>-stems, the element <tt>sma</tt> (f. <tt>sy</tt>), and which shifts to <tt>am\u012b</tt> in part of the masc. and neut. plural. In part, too, like an adjective <tt>u</tt>-stem, it lengthens its final in the feminine.

Various forms of this pronoun, as <tt>kad, kim</tt>, and <tt>ku</tt> (and, rarely, <tt>ko</tt>), at the beginning of compounds, have passed from an interrogative meaning, through an exclamatory, to the value of prefixes signifying an unusual quality \u2014 either something admirable, or, oftener, something contemptible. This use begins in the Veda, but becomes much more common in later time. \n\n507. The interrogative pronoun, as in other languages, turns readily in its independent use also to an exclamatory meaning.

The use of <tt>y\u00e1t</tt> as representative stem begins very early: we have <tt>y\u00e1tk\u0101ma</tt> in the Veda, and <tt>yatk\u0101r\u00edn</tt>, <tt>yaddevaty\u00e0</tt> in the <tt>Br\u0101hma\u1e47a</tt>; later it grows more general.

One or two marked peculiarities in the Sanskrit use of the relative may be here briefly noticed: \n\na.

All these words form their feminines in <tt>\u0101</tt>. \n\nh. Other derivatives of a like value have no claim to be mentioned here. But (excepting <tt>sva</tt>) the possessives are so rarely used as to make but a small figure in the language, which prefers generally to indicate the possessive relation by the genitive case of the pronoun itself. \n\n517.

They have a quasi-numeral character, and are inflected (like the numerals <tt>p\u00e1\u00f1ca</tt> etc.: above, 483) only in the plural, and with the bare stem as nom. and accus.: thus, N.A. <tt>t\u00e1ti</tt>; I. etc. <tt>t\u00e1tibhis, t\u00e1tibhyas, t\u00e1t\u012bn\u0101m, t\u00e1ti\u1e63u</tt>. \n\n520.

For their inflection, see below, 523. \n\n521.

Such are <tt>s\u00e1rva</tt> ''all'', <tt>v\u00ed\u00e7va</tt> ''all, every'', <tt>\u00e9ka</tt> ''one''. \n\na.

Yet other words follow the same model usually, or in some of their significations, or optionally; but in other senses, or without known rule, lapse into the adjective inflection. \n\na.

Further, besides the simpler or ordinary conjugation of a verbal root, there are certain more or less fully developed secondary or derivative conjugations.\n\n528. Voice. There are (as in Greek) two voices, active and middle, distinguished by a difference in the personal endings. This distinction is a pervading one: there is no active personal form which does not have its corresponding middle, and ''vice versa;'' and it is extended also in part to the participles (but not to the infinitive).\n\n529. An active form is called by the Hindu grammarians <tt>parasm\u0101i padam</tt> ''a word for another'', and a middle form is called <tt>\u0101tmane padam</tt> ''a word for one's self'': the terms might be best paraphrased by ''transitive'' and ''reflexive''. And the distinction thus expressed is doubtless the original foundation of the difference of active and middle forms; in the recorded condition of the language, however, the antithesis of transitive and reflexive meaning is in no small measure blurred, or even altogether effaced. \n\na. In the epics there is much effacement of the distinction between active and middle, the choice of voice being very often determined by \nmetrical considerations alone. \n\n530. Some verbs are conjugated in both voices, others in one only; sometimes a part of the tenses are inflected only in one voice, others only in the other or in both; of a verb usually inflected in one voice sporadic forms of the other occur; and sometimes the voice differs according as the verb is compounded with certain prepositions.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"390538":{"pageid":390538,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/229","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\n531. The middle forms outside the present-system (for which there is a special passive inflection: see below, 768 ff.), and sometimes also within that system, are liable to be used likewise in a passive sense.\n\n532. Tense. The tenses are as follows: 1. a present, with 2. an imperfect, closely related with it in form, having a prefixed augment; 3. a perfect, made with reduplication (to which in the Veda is added, 4. a so-called pluperfect, made from it with prefixed augment); 5. an aorist, of three different formations: a. simple; b. reduplicated; c. sigmatic or sibilant; 6. a future, with 7. a conditional, an augment-tense, standing to it in the relation of an imperfect to a present; and 8. a second, a periphrastic, future (not found in the Veda). \n\na. The tenses here distinguished (in accordance with prevailing usage) as imperfect, perfect, pluperfect, and aorist receive those names from their correspondence in mode of formation with tenses so called in other languages of the family, especially in Greek, and not at all from differences of time designated by them. In no period of the Sanskrit language is there any expression of imperfect or pluperfect time \u2014 nor of perfect time, except in the older language, \nwhere the \"aorist\" has this value; later, imperfect, perfect, and aorist are so many undiscriminated past tenses or preterits: see below, under the different tenses. \n\n533. Mode. In respect to mode, the difference between the classical Sanskrit and the older language of the Veda \u2014 and, in a less degree, of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as \u2014 is especially great.\n\na. In the Veda, the present tense has, besides its indicative inflection, a subjunctive, of considerable variety of formation, an optative, and an imperative (in 2d and 3d persons). The same three modes are found, though of much less frequent occurrence, as belonging to the perfect; and they are made also from the aorists, \nbeing of especial frequency from the simple aorist. The future has no modes (an occasional case or two are purely exceptional). \n\nb. In the classical Sanskrit, the present adds to its indicative an optative and an imperative \u2014 of which last, <noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"390539":{"pageid":390539,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/230","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>moreover, the first persons are a remnant of the old subjunctive. And the aorist has also an optative, of somewhat peculiar inflection, usually called the precative (or benedictive). \n\n534. The present, perfect, and future tenses have each of them, alike in the earlier and later language, a pair of participles, active and middle, sharing in the various peculiarities of the tense-formations; and in the Veda are found such participles belonging also to the aorist.\n\n535. Tense-systems. The tenses, then, with their accompanying modes and participles, fall into certain well-marked groups or systems:\n\nI. The present-system, composed of the present tense with its modes, its participle, and its preterit which we have called the imperfect. \n\nII. The perfect-system, composed of the perfect tense (with, in the Veda, its modes and its preterit, the so-called pluperfect) and its participle. \n\nIII. The aorist-system, or systems, simple, reduplicated, and sibilant, composed of the aorist tense along with, in the later language, its \"precative\" optative (but, in the Veda, with its various modes and its participle). \n\nIV. The future-systems: 1. the old or sibilant future, with its accompanying preterit, the conditional, and its participle; and 2. the new periphrastic future.\n\n536. Number and Person. The verb has, of course, the same three numbers with the noun: namely, singular, dual, and plural; and in each number it has the three persons, first, second, and third. All of these are made in every tense and mode \u2014 except that the first persons of the imperative numbers are supplied from the subjunctive. <noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"390540":{"pageid":390540,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/231","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\n537. Verbal adjectives and nouns: Participles. The participles belonging to the tense-systems have been already spoken of above (534). There is besides, coming directly from the root of the verb, a participle, prevailingly of past and passive (or sometimes neuter) meaning. Future passive participles, or gerundives, of several different formations, are also made. \n\n538. Infinitives. In the older language, a very considerable variety of derivative abstract nouns \u2014 only in a few sporadic instances having anything to do with the tense-systems \u2014 are used in an infinitive or quasi-infinitive sense; most often in the dative case, but sometimes also in the accusative, in the genitive and ablative, and (very rarely) in the locative. In the classical Sanskrit, there remains a single infinitive, of accusative case-form, having nothing to do with the tense-systems. \n\n539. Gerunds. A so-called gerund (or absolutive) \u2014 being, like the infinitive, a stereotyped case-form of a derivative noun \u2014 is a part of the general verb-system in both the earlier and later language, being especially frequent in the later language, where it has only two forms, one for simple verbs, and the other for compound. Its value is that of an indeclinable active participle, of indeterminate but prevailingly past tense-character. \n\na. Another gerund, an adverbially used accusative in form, is found, but only rarely, both earlier and later. \n\n540. Secondary conjugations. The secondary or derivative conjugations are as follows: 1. the passive; 2. the intensive; 3. the desiderative; 4. the causative. In these, a conjugation-stem, instead of the simple root, underlies the whole system of inflection. Yet there is clearly to be seen in them the character of a present-system, expanded into a more or less complete conjugation; and the passive is <noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"390541":{"pageid":390541,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/232","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>so purely a present-system that it will be described in the chapter devoted to that part of the inflection of the verb. \n\na.

And finally, that of periphrastic conjugation, or the looser combination of auxiliaries with verbal \nnouns and adjectives. \n\n541. The characteristic of a proper (finite or personal) verb-form is its personal ending. By this alone is determined its character as regards number and person \u2014 and in part also as regards mode and tense. But the distinctions of mode and tense are mainly made by the formation of tense and mode-stems, to which, rather than to the pure \nroot, the personal endings are appended. \n\na. In this chapter will be given a general account of the personal endings, and also of the formation of mode-stems from tense-stems, and of those elements in the formation of tense-stems \u2014  the augment and the reduplication \u2014 which are found in more than one tense-system.

The endings of verbal inflection are, as was pointed out above, different throughout in the active and middle voices. They are also, as in Greek, usually of two somewhat varying forms for \nthe same person in the same voice: one fuller, called primary; the {{SIC|ther|other}} briefer, called secondary. There are also less pervading differences, depending upon other conditions. \n\na. In the epics, exchanges of primary and secondary active endings {{SIC|eespecially|(especially}} the substitution of <tt>ma, va, ta,</tt> for <tt>mas, vas, tha</tt>) are not infrequent. <noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"390545":{"pageid":390545,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/233","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\nb. A condensed statement of all the varieties of ending for each person and number here follows. \n\n543. Singular: First person, a. The primary ending in the active is <tt>mi</tt>. The subjunctive, however (later imperative), has <tt>ni</tt> instead; and in the oldest Veda this <tt>ni</tt> is sometimes wanting, and the person ends in <tt>\u0101</tt> (as if the <tt>ni</tt> of <tt>\u0101ni</tt> were dropped). The secondary ending is properly <tt>m</tt>; but to this <tt>m</tt> an <tt>a</tt> has come to be so persistently prefixed, appearing regularly where the tense-stem does not itself end in <tt>a</tt> (<tt>vam</tt> for <tt>varm</tt> or <tt>varam</tt> in RV., once, and <tt>abh\u016bm</tt> MS., <tt>avadh\u012bm</tt> TS. etc., <tt>sanem</tt> TB., are rare anomalies), that it is convenient to reckon <tt>am</tt> as ending, rather than <tt>m</tt>. But the perfect tense has neither <tt>mi</tt> nor <tt>m</tt>; its ending is simply <tt>a</tt> (sometimes <tt>\u0101</tt>: 248 c); or, from <tt>\u0101</tt>-roots, <tt>\u0101u</tt>. \n\nb. The primary middle ending, according to the analogy of the other persons, would be regularly <tt>me</tt>. But no tense or mode, at any period of the language, shows any relic whatever of a <tt>m</tt> in this person; the primary ending, present as well as perfect, from <tt>a</tt>-stems and others alike, is <tt>e</tt>; and to it corresponds <tt>i</tt> as secondary ending, which blends with the final of an <tt>a</tt>-stem to <tt>e</tt>. The optative has, however, <tt>a</tt> instead of <tt>i</tt>; and in the subjunctive (later imperative) appears <tt>\u0101i</tt> for <tt>e</tt>. \n\n544. Second person. a. In the active, the primary ending is <tt>si</tt>, which is shortened to <tt>s</tt> as secondary; as to the loss of this <tt>s</tt> after a final radical consonant, see below, 555. But the perfect and the imperative desert here entirely the analogy of the other forms. The perfect ending is invariably <tt>tha</tt> (or <tt>th\u0101</tt>: 248 c). The imperative is far less regular. The fullest form of its ending is <tt>dhi</tt>; which, however, is more often reduced to <tt>hi</tt>; and in the great majority of verbs (including all <tt>a</tt>-stems, at every period of the language) no ending is present, but the bare stem stands as personal form. In a very small class of verbs (722\u20133), <tt>\u0101na</tt> is the ending. There is also an alternative ending <tt>t\u0101t</tt>; and this is even used sporadically in other persons of the imperative (see below, 570\u20131). \n\nb. In the middle voice, the primary ending, both present and perfect, is <tt>se</tt>. The secondary stands in no apparent relation to this, being <tt>th\u0101s</tt>; and in the imperative is found only <tt>sva</tt> (or <tt>sv\u0101</tt>: 248 c), which in the Veda is not seldom to be read as <tt>sua</tt>. In the older language, <tt>se</tt> is sometimes strengthened to <tt>s\u0101i</tt> in the subjunctive. \n\n545. Third person. a. The active primary ending is <tt>ti</tt>; the secondary, tt>t</tt>; as to the loss of the latter after a final radical consonant, see below, 555. But in the imperative appears instead the peculiar ending <tt>tu</tt>; and in the perfect no characteristic consonant is present, and the third person has the same ending as the first. \n\nb. The primary middle ending is <tt>te</tt>, with <tt>ta</tt> as corresponding secondary. In the older language, <tt>te</tt> is often strengthened to <tt>t\u0101i</tt> in<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"390547":{"pageid":390547,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/234","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>the subjunctive. In the perfect, the middle third person has, like the active, the same ending with the first, namely <tt>e</tt> simply; and in the older language, the third person present also often loses the distinctive part of its termination, and comes to coincide in form with the first (and MS. has <tt>aduha</tt> for <tt>adugdha</tt>). To this <tt>e</tt> perhaps corresponds, as secondary, the <tt>i</tt> of the aorist 3d pers. passive (842 ff.). The imperative has <tt>t\u0101m</tt> (or, in the Veda, rarely <tt>\u0101m</tt>) for its ending. \n\n546. Dual: First person. Both in active and in middle, the dual first person is in all its varieties precisely like the corresponding plural, only with substitution of <tt>v</tt> for the <tt>m</tt> of the latter: thus, <tt>vas</tt> (no <tt>vasi</tt> has been found to occur), <tt>va</tt>, <tt>vahe</tt>, <tt>vahi</tt>, <tt>vah\u0101i</tt>. The person is, of course, of comparatively rare use, and from the Veda no form in <tt>vas</tt>, even, is quotable. \n\n547. Second and Third persons. a. In the active, the primary ending of the second person is <tt>thas</tt>, and that of the third is <tt>tas</tt>; and this relation of <tt>th</tt> to <tt>t</tt> appears also in the perfect, and runs through the whole series of middle endings. The perfect endings are primary, but have <tt>u</tt> instead of <tt>a</tt> as vowel; and an <tt>a</tt> has become so persistently prefixed that their forms have to be reckoned as <tt>athus</tt> and <tt>atus</tt>. The secondary endings exhibit no definable relation to the primary in these two persons; they are <tt>tam</tt> and <tt>t\u0101m</tt>; and they are used in the imperative as well. \n\nb. In the middle, a long <tt>\u0101</tt> \u2014 which, however, with the final <tt>a</tt> of <tt>a</tt>-stems becomes <tt>e</tt> \u2014 has become prefixed to all dual endings of the second and third persons, so as to form an inseparable part of them (<tt>d\u012bdh\u012bth\u0101m</tt> AV., and <tt>jih\u012bth\u0101m</tt> \u00c7B., are isolated anomalies). The primary endings, present and perfect, are <tt>\u0101the</tt> and <tt>\u0101te</tt>; the secondary (and imperative) are <tt>\u0101th\u0101m</tt> and <tt>\u0101t\u0101m</tt> (or, with stem-final <tt>a</tt>, <tt>ethe</tt> etc.). \n\nc. The Rig-Veda has a very few forms in <tt>\u0101ithe</tt> and <tt>\u0101ite</tt>, apparently from <tt>ethe</tt> and <tt>ete</tt> with subjunctive strengthening (they are all detailed below: see 615, 701, 737, 752, 836, 1008, 1043). \n\n548. Plural: First person. a. The earliest form of the active ending is <tt>masi</tt>, which in the oldest language is more frequent than the briefer <tt>mas</tt> (in RV., as five to one; in AV., however, only as three to four). In the classical Sanskrit, <tt>mas</tt> is the exclusive primary ending; but the secondary abbreviated <tt>ma</tt> belongs also to the perfect and the subjunctive (imperative).

But in the perfect any characteristic consonant is wanting, and the ending is simply <tt>a</tt>. In the Veda, the syllable <tt>na</tt>, of problematic origin, is not infrequently added to both forms of the ending, making <tt>thana</tt> (rarely <tt>than\u0101</tt>) and <tt>tana</tt>. The forms in which this occurs will be detailed below, under the different formations; the addition is very rarely made excepting to persons of the first general conjugation. \n\nb. The middle primary ending is <tt>dhve</tt>, which belongs to the perfect as well as the present. In the subjunctive of the older language it is sometimes strengthened to <tt>dhv\u0101i</tt>. The secondary (and imperative) ending is <tt>dhvam</tt> (in RV., once <tt>dhva</tt>); and <tt>dhv\u0101t</tt> is once met with in the imperative (570). In the Veda, the <tt>v</tt> of all these endings is sometimes to be resolved into <tt>u</tt>, and the ending becomes dissyllabic. As to the change of <tt>dh</tt> of these endings to <tt>\u1e0dh</tt>, see above, 226 c. \n\n550. Third person. a. The full primary ending is <tt>anti</tt> in the active, with <tt>ante</tt> as corresponding middle. The middle secondary ending is <tt>anta</tt>, to which should correspond an active <tt>ant</tt>; but of the <tt>t</tt> only altogether questionable traces are left, in the euphonic treatment of a final <tt>n</tt> (207); the ending is <tt>an</tt>. In the imperative, <tt>antu</tt> and <tt>ant\u0101m</tt> take the place of <tt>anti</tt> and <tt>ante</tt>. The initial <tt>a</tt> of all these endings is like that of <tt>am</tt> in the 1st sing., disappearing after the final <tt>a</tt> of a tense-stem. \n\nb. Moreover, <tt>anti</tt>, <tt>antu</tt>, <tt>ante</tt>, <tt>ant\u0101m</tt>, <tt>anta</tt> are all liable to be weakened by the loss of their nasal, becoming <tt>ati</tt> etc. In the active, this weakening takes place only after reduplicated non-<tt>a</tt>-stems (and after a few roots which are treated as if reduplicated: 639 ff.); in the middle, it occurs after all tense-stems save those ending in <tt>a</tt>. \n\nc. Further, for the secondary active ending <tt>an</tt> there is a substitute <tt>us</tt> (or <tt>ur</tt>: 169 b; the evidence of the Zend favors the latter form), which is used in the same reduplicating verbs that change <tt>anti</tt> to <tt>ati</tt> etc., and which accordingly appears as a weaker correlative of <tt>an</tt>. The same us is also used universally in the perfect, in the optative (not in the subjunctive), in those forms of the aorist whose stem does not end in <tt>a</tt>, and in the imperfect of root-stems ending in <tt>\u0101</tt>, and a few others (621). \n\nd. The perfect middle has in all periods of the language the peculiar ending <tt>re</tt>, and the optative has the allied <tt>ran</tt>, in this person. In the Veda, a variety of other endings containing a <tt>r</tt> as distinctive consonant are met with: namely, <tt>re</tt> (and <tt>ire</tt>) and <tt>rate</tt> in the present; <tt>rata</tt> in the optative (both of present and of aorist); <tt>rire</tt> in the perfect; <tt>ranta, ran</tt>, and <tt>ram</tt> in aorists (and in an imperfect or two); <tt>r\u0101m</tt> and <tt>rat\u0101m</tt> in the imperative; <tt>ra</tt> in the imperfect of <tt>duh</tt> (MS.). The three <tt>rate</tt>, <tt>ratam</tt>, and <tt>rata</tt> are found even in the later language in one or two verbs (629).<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"390551":{"pageid":390551,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/236","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\n551. Below are given, for convenience, in tabular form, the schemes of endings as accepted in the classical or later language: namely, a. the regular primary endings, used in the present indicative and the future (and the subjunctive in part); and b. the regular secondary endings, used in the imperfect, the conditional, the aorist, the optative (and the subjunctive in part); and further, of special schemes, c. the perfect endings (chiefly primary, especially in the middle); and d. the imperative endings (chiefly secondary). To the so-called imperative endings of the first person is prefixed the <tt>\u0101</tt> which is practically a part of them, though really containing the mode-sign of the subjunctive from which they are derived. \n\n552. Further, a part of the endings are marked with an accent, and a part are left unaccented. The latter are those which never, under any circumstances, receive the accent; the former are accented in considerable classes of verbs, though by no means in all. It will be noticed that, in general, the unaccented endings are those of the singular active; but the 2d sing. {{SIC|imkerative|imperative}} has an accented ending; and, on the other hand, the whole series of 1st persons imperative, active and middle, have unaccented endings (this being a characteristic of the subjunctive formation which they represent). \n\n553.

The secondary endings of the second and third persons singular, as consisting of an added consonant without vowel, should regularly (150) be lost whenever the root or stem to which they are to be added itself ends in a consonant. And this rule is in general followed; yet not without exceptions. Thus: \n\na. A root ending in a dental mute sometimes drops this final mute instead of the added <tt>s</tt> in the second person; and, on the other hand, a root or stem ending in <tt>s</tt> sometimes drops this <tt>s</tt> instead of the added <tt>t</tt> in the third person \u2013 in either case, establishing the ordinary relation of <tt>s</tt> and <tt>t</tt> in these persons, instead of <tt>s</tt> and <tt>s</tt>, or <tt>t</tt> and <tt>t</tt>. The examples noted are: 2d sing. <tt>aves</tt> (to 3d sing. <tt>avet</tt>), \u221a<tt>vid</tt>, AB.; 3d sing. <tt>akat</tt>, \u221a<tt>k\u1e5b</tt>, \u00c7B. <tt>aghat</tt>, \u221a<tt>ghas</tt>, JB.

A similar loss of any other final consonant is excessively rare; AV. has once <tt>abhanas</tt>, for <tt>-nak</tt>, \u221a<tt>bha\u00f1j</tt>. There are also a few cases where a 1st sing. is irregularly modeled after a 3d sing.: thus, <tt>at\u1e5b\u1e47am</tt> (to <tt>at\u1e5b\u1e47at</tt>), \u221a<tt>t\u1e5bd</tt>, KU., <tt>acchinam</tt> (to <tt>acchinat</tt>), \u221a<tt>chid</tt>, MBh.: compare {{SIC|urther|further}} the 1st sing. in <tt>m</tt> instead of <tt>am</tt>, 543 a. \n\nb.

In a few isolated cases in the older language, this <tt>\u012b</tt> is changed to <tt>\u0101i</tt>: see below, 904 b, 936, 1068 a. \n\n556. The changes of form which roots and stems undergo in their combinations with these endings will be pointed out in detail below, under the various formations. Here may be simply mentioned in advance, as by far the most important among them, a distinction of stronger and weaker form of stem in large classes of verbs, standing in relation with the accent \u2013 the stem being of stronger form when the accent falls upon it, or before an accentless ending, and of weaker form when the accent is on the ending. \n\na. Of the endings marked as accented in the scheme, the <tt>ta</tt> of 2d pl. is not infrequently in the Veda treated as unaccented, the tone resting on the stem, which is strengthened. Much less often, the <tt>tam</tt> of 2d du. is treated in the same way; other endings, only sporadically. Details are given under the various formations below. \n\n<center>Subjunctive Mode.</center> \n\n557.

In the oldest period, however, it was a very frequent formation, being three or four times as common as the optative in the Rig-Veda, and nearly the same in the Atharvan; but already in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as it becomes comparatively rare. Its varieties of form are considerable, and sometimes perplexing. \n\n558. In its normal and regular formation, a special mode-stem is made for the subjunctive by adding to the tense-stem an <tt>a</tt> \u2013 which combines with a final <tt>a</tt> of the tense-stem to <tt>\u0101</tt>. The accent rests upon the tense-stem, which accordingly has the strong form. Thus, from the strong present-stem <tt>doh</tt> (\u221a<tt>duh</tt>) is made the subjunctive-stem <tt>d\u00f3ha</tt>; from <tt>juh\u00f3</tt> (\u221a<tt>hu</tt>), <tt>juh\u00e1va</tt>; from <tt>yun\u00e1j</tt> (\u221a<tt>yuj</tt>), <tt>yun\u00e1ja</tt>; from <tt>sun\u00f3</tt> (\u221a<tt>su</tt>), <tt>sun\u00e1va</tt>; from <tt>bh\u00e1va</tt> (\u221a<tt>bh\u016b</tt>), <tt>bh\u00e1v\u0101</tt>; from <tt>tud\u00e1</tt> (\u221a<tt>tud</tt>), <tt>tud\u0101\u0301</tt>; from <tt>ucy\u00e1</tt> (pass., \u221a<tt>vac</tt>), <tt>ucy\u0101\u0301</tt>; and so on. \n\n559. The stem thus formed is inflected in general as an <tt>a</tt>-stem would be inflected in the indicative, with constant accent, and <tt>\u0101</tt> for <tt>a</tt> before the endings of the first person (733 i) \u2013 but with the following peculiarities as to ending etc.: \n\n560. a. In the active, the 1st sing. has <tt>ni</tt> as ending: thus, <tt>d\u00f3h\u0101ni</tt>, <tt>yun\u00e1j\u0101ni</tt>, <tt>bh\u00e1v\u0101ni</tt>. But in the Rig-Veda sometimes <tt>\u0101</tt> simply: thus, <tt>\u00e1y\u0101</tt>, <tt>br\u00e1v\u0101</tt>. \n\nb. In 1st du., 1st pl., and 3d pl., the endings are the secondary: thus, <tt>d\u00f3h\u0101va</tt>, <tt>d\u00f3h\u0101ma</tt>, <tt>d\u00f3han</tt>; <tt>bh\u00e1v\u0101va</tt>, <tt>bh\u00e1v\u0101ma</tt>, <tt>bh\u00e1v\u0101n</tt>. \n\nc. In 2d and 3d du. and 2d pl., the endings are primary: thus, <tt>d\u00f3hathas</tt>, <tt>d\u00f3hatas</tt>, <tt>d\u00f3hatha</tt>; <tt>bh\u00e1v\u0101thas</tt>, <tt>bh\u00e1v\u0101tas</tt>, <tt>bh\u00e1v\u0101tha</tt>. \n\nd. In 2d and 3d sing., the endings are either primary or secondary: thus, <tt>d\u00f3hasi</tt> or <tt>d\u00f3has</tt>, <tt>d\u00f3hati</tt> or <tt>d\u00f3hat</tt>; <tt>bh\u00e1v\u0101si</tt> or <tt>bh\u00e1v\u0101s</tt>, <tt>bh\u00e1v\u0101ti</tt> or <tt>bh\u00e1v\u0101t</tt>. \n\ne. Occasionally, forms with double mode-sign <tt>\u0101</tt> (by assimilation to the more numerous subjunctives from tense-stems in <tt>a</tt>) are met with from non-<tt>a</tt>-stems: thus, <tt>\u00e1s\u0101tha</tt> from <tt>as</tt>; <tt>\u00e1y\u0101s</tt>, <tt>\u00e1y\u0101t</tt>, <tt>\u00e1y\u0101n</tt> from <tt>e</tt> (\u221a<tt>i</tt>). \n\n561. In the middle, forms with secondary instead of primary endings are very rare, being found only in the 3d pl. (where they are more frequent than the primary), and in a case or two of the 3d sing. (and AB. has once asy\u0101th\u0101s). \n\na. The striking peculiarity of subjunctive middle inflection is the frequent strengthening of <tt>e</tt> to <tt>\u0101i</tt> in the endings. This is less general in the very earliest language than later. In 1st sing., <tt>\u0101i</tt> alone is found as ending, even in RV.; and in 1st du. also (of rare occurrence), only <tt>\u0101vah\u0101i</tt> is met with. In 1st pl., <tt>\u0101mah\u0101i</tt> prevails in RV. and AV. (<tt>\u0101mahe</tt> is found a few times), and is alone known later. In 2d sing., <tt>s\u0101i</tt> for <tt>se</tt> does not occur in RV., but is the only form in AV. and the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as.

The imperative has no mode-sign; it is made by adding its own endings directly to the tense-stem, just as the other endings are added to form the indicative tenses. \n\na. Hence, in 2d and 3d du. and 2d pl., its forms are indistinguishable from those of the augment-preterit from the same stem with its augment omitted. \n\nb. The rules as to the use of the different endings \u2014 especially in 2d sing., where the variety is considerable \u2014 will be given below, in connection with the various tense-systems. The ending <tt>t\u0101t</tt>, however, has so much that is peculiar in its use that it calls for a little explanation here. \n\n570. The Imperative in <tt>t\u0101t</tt>. An imperative form, usually having the value of a 2d pers. sing., but sometimes also of other persons and numbers, is made by adding <tt>t\u0101t</tt> to a present tense-stem \u2014 in its weak form, if it have a distinction of strong and weak form. \n\na.

No examples have been found from a nasal-class verb (690), nor any other than those here given from a passive, intensive, or desiderative. The few accented cases indicate that the formation follows the general rule for one made with an accented ending (552). \n\nb. The imperative in <tt>t\u0101t</tt> is not a very rare formation in the older language, being made (in V., B., and S.) from about fifty roots, and in toward a hundred and fifty occurrences. Later, it is very unusual: thus, only a single example has been noted in MBh., and one in R.; and correspondingly few in yet more modern texts. \n\n571. As regards its meaning, this form appears to have prevailingly in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and traceably but much less distinctly in the Vedic texts, a specific tense-value added to its mode-value \u2014 as signifying, namely, an injunction to be carried out at a later time than the present: it is (like the Latin forms in <tt>to</tt> and <tt>tote</tt>) a posterior or future imperative. \n\na.

''may your worship do the favor'', <tt>enam bhav\u0101n abhirak\u1e63at\u0101t</tt> (DKC.) ''let your excellency protect him''. \n\nc. According to the native grammarians, the imperative in <tt>t\u0101t</tt> is to be used with a benedictive implication. No instance of such use appears to be quotable. \n\nd. In a certain passage repeated several times in different Br\u0101hma\u1e47as and S\u016btras, and containing a number of forms in <tt>t\u0101t</tt> used as 2d pl., <tt>v\u0101rayadhv\u0101t</tt> is read instead of <tt>v\u0101rayat\u0101t</tt> in some of the texts (K.

Of the three modes, the imperative is the one most distinct and limited in office, and most unchanged in use throughout the whole history of the language. It signifies a command or injunction \u2014 an attempt at the exercise of the speaker's will upon some one or something outside of himself. \n\na. This, however (in Sanskrit as in other languages), is by no means always of the same force; the command shades off into a demand, an exhortation, an entreaty, an expression of earnest desire. The imperative also sometimes signifies an assumption or concession; and occasionally, by pregnant construction, it becomes the expression of something conditional or contingent; but it does not acquire any regular use in dependent-clause-making. \n\nb. The imperative is now and then used in an interrogative sentence: thus, <tt>brav\u012bhi ko \u2018dy\u0101i \u2019va may\u0101 viyujyat\u0101m</tt> (R.) ''speak! who shall now be separated by me''? <tt>katham ete gu\u1e47avanta\u1e25 kriyant\u0101m</tt> (H.) ''how are they to be made virtuous?'' <tt>kasm\u0101i pi\u1e47\u1e0da\u1e25 prad\u012byat\u0101m</tt> (Vet.) ''to whom shall the offering be given?'' \n\n573. The optative appears to have as its primary office the expression of wish or desire; in the oldest language, its prevailing use in independent clauses is that to which the name \"optative\" properly belongs. \n\na. But the expression of desire, on the one hand, passes naturally over into that of request or entreaty, so that the optative becomes a softened imperative; and, on the other hand, it comes to signify what is generally desirable or proper, what should or ought to be, and so becomes the mode of prescription; or, yet again, it is weakened into signifying what may or can be, what is likely or usual, and so becomes at last a softened statement of what is. \n\nb. Further, the optative in dependent clauses, with relative pronouns and conjunctions, becomes a regular means of expression of the conditional and contingent, in a wide and increasing variety of uses. \n\nc. The so-called precative forms (567) are ordinarily used in the proper optative sense. But in the later language they are occasionally met with in the other uses of the optative: thus, <tt>na hi prapa\u00e7y\u0101mi mam\u0101 \u2019panudy\u0101d yac chokam</tt> (Bh G.) ''for I do not perceive what should dispel my grief''; <tt>yad bh\u016by\u0101sur vibh\u016btaya\u1e25</tt> (BhP.) ''that there should be changes''. Also rarely with <tt>m\u0101</tt>: see 579 b.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"390560":{"pageid":390560,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/244","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\n574. The subjunctive, as has been pointed out, becomes nearly extinct at an early period in the history of the language; there are left of it in classical usage only two relics: the use of its first persons in an imperative sense, or to signify a necessity or obligation resting on the speaker, or a peremptory intention on his part; and the use of unaugmented forms (579), with the negative particle \u092e\u093e  <tt>m\u0101\u0301,</tt> in a prohibitive or negative imperative sense. \n\na. And the general value of the subjunctive from the beginning was what these relics would seem to indicate; its fundamental meaning is perhaps that of requisition, less peremptory than the imperative, more so than the optative. But this meaning is liable to the same modifications and transitions with that of the optative; and subjunctive and optative run closely parallel with one another in the oldest language in their use in independent clauses, and are hardly distinguishable in dependent. And instead of their being (as in Greek) both maintained in use, and endowed with nicer and more distinctive values, the subjunctive gradually disappears, and the optative assumes alone the offices formerly shared by both. \n\n575. The difference, then, between imperative and subjunctive and optative, in their fundamental and most characteristic uses, is one of degree: command, requisition, wish; and no sharp line of division exists between them; they are more or less exchangeable with one another, and combinable in co\u00f6rdinate clauses. \n\na. Thus, in AV., we have in impv.: <tt>\u00e7at\u00e1\u1e41 j\u012bva \u00e7ar\u00e1da\u1e25 </tt> ''do thou live a hundred autumns''; <tt>ubh\u0101\u00fa t\u0101\u00fa j\u012bvat\u0101\u1e41 jar\u00e1da\u1e63\u1e6d\u012b</tt> ''let them both live to attain old age''; \u2014 in subj., <tt>ady\u00e1 j\u012bv\u0101ni</tt> ''let me live this day''; <tt>\u00e7at\u00e1\u1e41 j\u012bv\u0101ti \u00e7ar\u00e1da\u1e25</tt> ''he shall live a hundred autumns;'' \u2014 in opt., <tt>j\u012b\u0301vema \u00e7ar\u00e1d\u0101\u1e41 \u00e7at\u0101\u0301ni</tt> ''may we live hundreds of autumns''; <tt>s\u00e1rvam \u0101\u0301yur j\u012bvy\u0101sam</tt> (prec.)

The uses of the optative in the later language are of the utmost variety, covering the whole field occupied jointly by the two modes in earlier time. A few examples from a single text (MBh.) will be enough to illustrate them: <tt>ucchi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 n\u0101i \u2019va bhu\u00f1j\u012bya\u1e41 na kury\u0101m p\u0101dadh\u0101vanam</tt> ''I will not eat of the remnant of the sacrifice, I will not perform the foot-lavation''; <tt>j\u00f1\u0101t\u012bn vrajet</tt> ''let her go to her relatives''; <tt>n\u0101i \u2019va\u1e41 s\u0101 karhicit kury\u0101t</tt> ''she should not act thus at any time''; <tt>katha\u1e41 vidy\u0101\u1e41 nala\u1e41 n\u1e5bpam</tt> ''how can I know king Nala?'' <tt>utsarge sa\u1e41\u00e7aya\u1e25 sy\u0101t tu vindet\u0101 \u2019pi sukha\u1e41 kvacit</tt> ''but in case of her abandonment there may be a chance; she may also find happiness somewhere''; <tt>katha\u1e41 v\u0101so vikarteya\u1e41 na ca budhyeta me priy\u0101</tt> ''how can I cut off the garment and my beloved not wake?'' \n\n578. The later use of the first persons subjunctive as so-called imperative involves no change of construction from former time, but only restriction to a single kind of use: thus, <tt>d\u012bvy\u0101va</tt> ''let us two play''; <tt>ki\u1e41 karav\u0101\u1e47i te</tt> ''what shall I do for thee?''\n\n579. The imperative negative, or prohibitive, is from the earliest period of the language regularly and usually expressed by the particle m\u0101\u0301 with an augmentless past form, prevailingly aorist. \n\na. Thus, <tt>pr\u00e1 pata m\u00e9 \u2019h\u00e1 ra\u1e41sth\u0101\u1e25</tt> (AV.)

''do not make friends of them;'' <tt>m\u0101 putram anutapyath\u0101\u1e25</tt> (MBh.) ''do not sorrow for thy son.'' The relation of the imperfect to the aorist construction, in point of frequency, is in RV. about as one to five, in AV. still less, or about one to six; and though instances of the imperfect are quotable from all the older texts, they are exceptional and infrequent; while in the epics and later they become extremely rare. \n\nb. A single optative, <tt>bhujema</tt>, is used prohibitively with <tt>m\u0101\u0301</tt> in RV.; the older language presents no other example, and the construction is very rare also later. In an example or two, also, the precative (<tt>bh\u016by\u0101t</tt>, R. Pa\u00f1c.) follows <tt>m\u0101</tt>. \n\nc. The RV. has once apparently <tt>m\u0101\u0301</tt> with an imperative; but the passage is probably corrupt. No other such case is met with in the older language (unless <tt>s\u1e5bpa</tt>. TA. i. 14; doubtless a bad reading for <tt>s\u1e5bpas</tt>); but in the epics and later the construction begins to appear, and becomes an ordinary form of prohibition: thus, <tt>m\u0101 prayacche \u201d\u00e7vare dhanam</tt> (H.) ''do not bestow wealth on a lord;'' <tt>sakhi m\u0101i \u2019va\u1e41 vada</tt> (Vet.) ''friend, do not speak thus.'' \n\nd. The \u00c7B. (xi. 5. 1 <sup>1</sup>) appears to offer a single example of a true subjunctive with <tt>m\u0101, n\u00ed pady\u0101s\u0101i</tt>; there is perhaps something wrong about the reading. \n\ne. In the epics and later, an aorist form not deprived of augment is occasionally met with after <tt>m\u0101</tt>: thus, <tt>m\u0101 tv\u0101\u1e41 k\u0101lo \u2018tyag\u0101t</tt> (MBh.) ''let not the time pass thee;'' <tt>m\u0101 v\u0101lipatham anv ag\u0101\u1e25</tt> (R.) ''do not follow V\u0101li's road.'' But the same anomaly occurs also two or three times in the older language: thus, <tt>vy\u00e0paptat</tt> (\u00c7B.), <tt>ag\u0101s</tt> (TA.), <tt>ana\u00e7at</tt> (KS.). \n\n580. But the use also of the optative with <tt>n\u00e1</tt> ''not'' in a prohibitive sense appears in the Veda, and becomes later a familiar construction: thus, <tt>n\u00e1 ri\u1e63yema kad\u0101\u0301 can\u00e1</tt> (RV.) ''may we suffer no harm at any time;'' <tt>n\u00e1 c\u0101 \u2019tis\u1e5bj\u00e9n n\u00e1 juhuy\u0101t</tt> (AV.)

This in the later language is the correlative of the prescriptive optative, and both are extremely common; so that in a text of prescriptive character the optative forms may come to outnumber the indicative and imperative together (as is the case, for example, in Manu). \n\n581. In all dependent constructions, it is still harder even in the oldest language to establish a definite distinction between subjunctive and optative; a method of use of either is scarcely to be found to which the other does not furnish a practical equivalent \u2014<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"390563":{"pageid":390563,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/247","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>and then, in the later language, such uses are represented by the optative alone.

With the conditional use of subjunctive and optative is farther to be compared that of the so-called conditional tense: see below, 950. \n\nf. As is indicated by many of the examples given above, it is usual in a conditional sentence, containing protasis and apodosis, to employ always the same mode, whether subjunctive or optative (or conditional), in each of the two clauses. For the older language, this is a rule well-nigh or quite without exception. \n\n582. No distinction of meaning has been established between the modes of the present-system and those (in the older language) of the perfect and aorist-systems. \n\n<center>Participles.</center> \n\n583. Participles, active and middle, are made from all the tense-stems \u2014 except the periphrastic future, and, in the later language, the aorist (and aorist participles are rare from the beginning). \n\na. The participles unconnected with the tense-systems are treated in chap. XIII. (952 ff.). \n\n584. The general participial endings are \u0905\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d <tt>ant</tt> (weak form \u0905\u0924\u094d <tt>at</tt>; fem. \u0905\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0940 <tt>ant\u012b</tt> or \u0905\u0924\u0940 <tt>at\u012b</tt>: see above, 449) for the active, and \u0906\u0928 <tt>\u0101na</tt> (fem. \u0906\u0928\u093e <tt>\u0101n\u0101</tt>) for the middle. But \u2014\n\na. After a tense-stem ending in <tt>a</tt>, the active participial suffix is virtually <tt>nt</tt>, one of the two <tt>a</tt>'s being lost in the combination of stem-final and suffix. \n\nb. After a tense-stem ending in <tt>a</tt>, the middle participial suffix is <tt>m\u0101na</tt> instead of <tt>\u0101na</tt>. But there are occasional exceptions to the rule as to the use of <tt>m\u0101na</tt> and <tt>\u0101na</tt> respectively, which will be pointed out in connection with the various formations below. Such exceptions are especially frequent in the causative: see 1043 f. \n\nc. The perfect has in the active the peculiar suffix <tt>v\u0101\u1e45s</tt> (weakest form <tt>u\u1e63</tt>, middle form <tt>vat</tt>; fem, <tt>u\u1e63\u012b</tt>: see, for the inflection of this participle, above, 458 ff.). \n\nd. For details, as to form of stem etc., and for special exceptions, see the following chapters. \n\n<center>Augment.</center> \n\n585. The augment is a short \u0905 <tt>a</tt>, prefixed to a tense-stem \u2014 and, if the latter begin with a vowel, combining with that vowel irregularly into the heavier or <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt> diphthong <noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"390565":{"pageid":390565,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/249","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>(136 a). It is always (without any exception) the accented element in the verbal form of which it makes a part. \n\na. In the Veda, the augment is in a few forms long <tt>\u0101</tt>: thus, <tt>\u0101\u0301na\u1e6d</tt>, <tt>\u0101\u0301var</tt>, <tt>\u0101v\u1e5b\u1e47i</tt>, <tt>\u0101\u0301v\u1e5b\u1e47ak</tt>, <tt>\u0101vidhyat</tt>, <tt>\u0101yunak</tt>, <tt>\u0101\u0301yukta</tt>, <tt>\u0101\u0301yuk\u1e63\u0101t\u0101m</tt>, <tt>\u0101\u0301ri\u1e47ak</tt>, <tt>\u0101\u0301r\u0101ik</tt> and <tt>y\u00e1s ta \u0101\u0301vidhat</tt>, RV. ii. 1. 7, 9?). \n\n586. The augment is a sign of past time. And an augment-preterit is made from each of the tense-stems from which the system of conjugation is derived: namely, the imperfect, from the present-stem; the pluperfect (in the Veda only), from the perfect-stem; the conditional, from the future-stem; while in the aorist such a preterit stands without any corresponding present indicative. \n\n587. In the early language, especially in the RV., the occurrence of forms identical with those of augment-tenses save for the lack of an augment is quite frequent. Such forms lose in general, along with the augment, the specific character of the tenses to which they belong; and they are then employed in part non-modally, with either a present or a past sense; and in part modally, with either a subjunctive or an optative sense \u2014 especially often and regularly after <tt>m\u0101</tt> prohibitive (579); and this last mentioned use comes down also into the later language. \n\na. In RV., the augmentless forms are more than half as common as the augmented (about 2000 and 3300), and are made from the present, perfect, and aorist-systems, but considerably over half from the aorist. Their non-modal and modal uses are of nearly equal frequency. The tense value of the non-modally used forms is more often past than present. Of the modally used forms, nearly a third are construed with <tt>m\u0101</tt> prohibitive; the rest have twice as often an optative as a proper subjunctive value. \n\nb. In AV., the numerical relations are very different. The augmentless forms are less than a third as many as the augmented (about 475 to 1450), and are prevailingly (more than four fifths) aoristic. The non-modal uses are only a tenth of the modal. Of the modally used forms, about four fifths are construed with <tt>m\u0101</tt> prohibitive; the rest are chiefly optative in value. Then, in the language of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as (not including the <tt>mantra</tt>-material which they contain), the loss of augment is, save in occasional sporadic cases, restricted to the prohibitive construction with <tt>m\u0101</tt>; and the same continues to be the case later. \n\nc. The accentuation of the augmentless forms is throughout in accordance with that of unaugmented tenses of similar formation. Examples will be given below, under the various tenses. \n\nd. Besides the augmentless aorist-forms with <tt>m\u0101</tt> prohibitive, there are also found occasionally in the later language augmentless imperfect-forms (very rarely aorist-forms), which have the same value as if they were augmented, and are for the most part examples of metrical license. They are especially frequent in the epics (whence some scores of them are quotable). <noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"390567":{"pageid":390567,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/250","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><center>Reduplication.</center> \n\n588. The derivation of conjugational and declensional stems from roots by reduplication, either alone or along with other formative elements, has been already spoken of (259), and the formations in which reduplication appears have been specified: they are, in primary verb-inflection, the present (of a certain class of verbs), the perfect (of nearly all), and the aorist (of a large number); and the intensive and desiderative secondary conjugations contain in their stems the same element. \n\n589. The general principle of reduplication is the prefixion to a root of a part of itself repeated \u2014 if it begin with consonants, the initial consonant and the vowel; if it begin with a vowel, that vowel, either alone or with a following consonant. The varieties of detail, however, are very considerable. Thus, especially, as regards the vowel, which in present and perfect and desiderative is regularly shorter and lighter in the reduplication than in the root-syllable, in aorist is longer, and in intensive is strengthened. The differences as regards an initial consonant are less, and chiefly confined to the intensive; for the others, certain general rules may be here stated, all further details being left to be given in connection with the account of the separate formations. \n\n590.
