Many of these are to be regarded as from an intensive conjugation-stem; but some of them show a form not met with in intensive conjugation. \n\n5. l. Derivatives with this suffix from roots as compounded with the verbal prefixes are quite common, in all the modes of formation (in each, in proportion to the frequency of independent words): constituting, in fact, considerably the largest body of derivative stems with prefixes. They are of both classes as to meaning. The accent is, with few exceptions, on the ending \u2014 and that, without any reference to the value of the stem as action-noun or agent-noun. \n\nm. Examples are: <tt>sa\u1e41gam\u00e1</tt> ''assembly'', <tt>nime\u1e63\u00e1</tt> ''wink'', <tt>abhidroh\u00e1</tt> ''enmity'', <tt>anukar\u00e1</tt> ''assistance'', <tt>ud\u0101n\u00e1</tt> ''inspiration'', <tt>praty\u0101\u00e7r\u0101v\u00e1</tt> ''response''; \u2014 <tt>paricar\u00e1</tt> ''wandering'', <tt>sa\u1e41jay\u00e1</tt> ''victorious'', <tt>vibodh\u00e1</tt> ''wakeful'', <tt>atiy\u0101j\u00e1</tt> ''over-pious'', <tt>ud\u0101r\u00e1</tt> ''inciting, elevated'', <tt>uttud\u00e1</tt> ''rousing'', <tt>sa\u1e41gir\u00e1</tt> ''swallowing'', <tt>\u0101dardir\u00e1</tt> ''crushing'', <tt>adhican\u0304kram\u00e1</tt> ''climbing''. \n\nn. The only definite class of exceptions in regard to accent appears to be that of the adverbial gerunds in <tt>am</tt> (above, 995), which are accented on the root-syllable. A very few other stems have the same tone: for example, <tt>utp\u0101\u0301ta</tt> ''portent'', <tt>\u0101\u00e7r\u00e9\u1e63a</tt> ''plague''. A few others, mostly agent-nouns, have the accent on the prefix: for example, <tt>vy\u00f2\u1e63a</tt> (i. e. <tt>v\u00ed-o\u1e63a</tt>) ''burning'', <tt>pr\u00e1tive\u00e7a</tt> ''neighbor'', <tt>\u0101\u0301bhaga</tt> ''sharing''; but also <tt>s\u00e1\u1e41k\u0101\u00e7a</tt> ''appearance''. \n\no. For the remaining compounds of these derivatives, with the inseparable prefixes and with other elements, see the next chapter. It may be merely mentioned here that such compounds are numerous, and that the <tt>a</tt>-derivative has often an active participial value, and is frequently preceded by a case-form, oftenest the accusative. \n\np. Many words in the language appear to end with a suffix <tt>a</tt>, while yet they are referable to no root which can be otherwise demonstrated as such. \n\n1149. \u0906 <tt>\u0101</tt>. The vast majority of stems in \u0906 <tt>\u0101</tt> are feminine adjectives, corresponding to masculines and neuters in \u0905 <tt>a</tt> (332, 334). But also many suffixes ending in \u0905 <tt>a</tt> have corresponding feminine forms in long \u0906 <tt>\u0101</tt>, making a greater or less number of action-nouns. These will be given under the different suffixes below. \n\na. There is further, however, a considerable body of feminine action-nouns made by adding <tt>\u0101</tt> to a root, and having an independent aspect; though they are doubtless in part transfers from the root-noun (1147). Usually they show an unstrengthened form of root, and (such as occur in accented texts) an accented suffix.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"397685":{"pageid":397685,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/476","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\na. How far it had gained a primary value in the early language is not easy to determine. Most of the words in <tt>in</tt> occurring in RV. and AV. are explainable as possessives; in many the other value is possible, and in a few it is distinctly suggested: thus, <tt>keval\u0101d\u00edn, bhadrav\u0101d\u00edn, nitod\u00edn, \u0101\u00e7\u0101r\u0101i\u1e63\u00edn, \u00e1n\u0101min, vivy\u0101dh\u00edn</tt>; from a tense-stem, <tt>-a\u00e7nuvin, -pa\u00e7yin</tt> (late); with aoristic <tt>s, -sak\u1e63\u00edn</tt>; and, with reduplication, <tt>niyay\u00edn</tt>, <tt>vad\u0101vadin</tt>. As the examples indicate, composition, both with prefixes and with other elements, is frequent; and, in all cases alike, the accent is on the suffix. \n\nb. Later, the primary employment is unquestionable, and examples of it, chiefly in composition, are frequent. The radical syllable is usually strengthened, a medial <tt>a</tt> being sometimes lengthened and sometimes remaining unchanged. Thus, <tt>satyav\u0101din</tt> ''truth-speaking'', <tt>abhibh\u0101\u1e63in</tt> ''addressing'', <tt>manoh\u0101rin</tt> ''soul-winning''. In <tt>bh\u0101vin</tt> has established itself a prevailingly future meaning, ''about to be''. \n\nc. The use of an accusative object with words in <tt>in</tt> was noticed above (271 b). \n\n1184. \u0908\u092f\u0938\u094d <tt>\u012byas</tt> and \u0907\u0937\u094d\u0920 <tt>i\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt>. These suffixes, which, from forming intensive adjectives corresponding to the adjective of root-form, have come to be used, within somewhat narrow limits, as suffixes of adjective comparison, have been already sufficiently treated above, under the head of comparison (466\u2013470). \n\na. It may be further noticed that <tt>jy\u00e9\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> has in the older language (only two or three times in RV.) the accent also on the final, <tt>jye\u1e63\u1e6dh\u00e1</tt>, and that its correlative also is <tt>kani\u1e63\u1e6dh\u00e1</tt> in the oldest language; <tt>p\u00e1r\u1e63i\u1e63\u1e6dha</tt> is made from a secondary form of root, with aoristic <tt>s</tt> added. \n\nb. When the comparative suffix has the abbreviated form <tt>yas</tt> (470 a), its <tt>y</tt> is never to be read in the Veda as <tt>i</tt>. \n\nc. No other suffixes make derivatives having participial value otherwise than in rare and sporadic cases; those that remain, therefore, will be taken up mainly in the order of their frequency and importance. \n\n1185. \u0924\u094d\u0930 <tt>tra</tt>. With this suffix are formed a few adjectives, and a considerable number of nouns, mostly neuter, and often having a specialized meaning, as signifying the means or instrument of the action expressed by the root. The latter has usually the <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening, but sometimes remains unchanged. The accent is various, but more often on the radical syllable. \n\na.

In a small number of words, mostly of rare occurrence, the reduplicated root is used without suffix.\n\nc. The Vedic cases are: with simple reduplication, <tt>sasy\u00e1d</tt>, <tt>cik\u00edt</tt>, <tt>dad\u1e5b\u0301h</tt>, <tt>didy\u00fa</tt> and <tt>didy\u00fat</tt>, <tt>juh\u016b\u0301</tt>, and perhaps <tt>g\u00e1n\u0304g\u0101</tt> and <tt>\u00e7\u00ed\u00e7u</tt>; with intensive reduplication, -<tt>nen\u012b\u0301</tt>, <tt>malimluc</tt>, <tt>yav\u012by\u00fadh</tt>, and <tt>j\u00f3g\u016b</tt> and <tt>v\u00e1n\u012bvan</tt> (with the intensive instead of the usual radical accent). In <tt>d\u00e1ridra</tt> is seen a transfer to the <tt>a</tt>-declension. <tt>As\u016bs\u016b\u0301</tt> is probably to be understood as a compound, <tt>as\u016b</tt>-<tt>s\u016b\u0301</tt>.\n\nd. If the root end in a short vowel, a <tt>t</tt> is regularly and usually added (383f\u2013h).\n\ne. Examples have been given at the place just quoted. In <tt>j\u00e1gat</tt> the <tt>t</tt> is added to the mutilated form of \u221a<tt>gam</tt> reduplicated, and <tt>\u1e5b\u1e47ay\u0101\u0301t</tt> (TS., once) appears to put it after a long vowel. In a single instance, <tt>\u00e7r\u00fatkar\u1e47a</tt> (RV.) ''of listening ears'', a stem of this class occurs as prior member of a compound.\n\nf. Words of this form in combination with verbal prefixes are very numerous. The accent rests (as in combination of the same with other preceding elements) on the root-stem.\n\ng. A few exceptions in point of accent occur: thus, <tt>\u00e1vas\u0101</tt>, <tt>\u00fapastut</tt>; and, with other irregularities of form, <tt>p\u00e1rijri</tt>, <tt>up\u00e1stha</tt>, <tt>upar\u00edstha</tt>.\n\n1148. \u0905 <tt>a</tt>. With the suffix \u0905 <tt>a</tt> is made an immensely large and heterogeneous body of derivatives, of various meaning and showing various treatment of the root: <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening, <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt>-strengthening, retention unchanged, and reduplication.\n\nIn good part, they are classifiable under the two usual general heads; but in part they have been individualized into more special senses.\n\n1. a. With <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening of the root (where that is possible: 235, 240). These are the great majority, being more than twice as numerous as all others together.\n\nb. Many ''nomina actionis'': as, <tt>\u00e7r\u00e1ma</tt> ''weariness'', <tt>gr\u00e1ha</tt> ''seizure'', <tt>\u00e1ya</tt> ''movement'', <tt>v\u00e9da</tt> ''knowledge'', <tt>h\u00e1va</tt> ''call'', <tt>kr\u00f3dha</tt> ''wrath'', <tt>j\u00f3\u1e63a</tt> ''enjoyment'', <tt>t\u00e1ra</tt> ''crossing'', <tt>s\u00e1rga</tt> ''emission''.\n\nC.

Of the examples here given, those under b accent the radical syllable, and those under c the ending. And this is in perhaps a majority of cases the fact as regards the two classes of derivatives; so that, taken in connection with kindred facts as to other suffixes, it hints at such a difference of accent as a general tendency of the language.

With this suffix (as with \u0905 <tt>a</tt>) are formed innumerable derivatives, of both the principal classes of meaning, and with not infrequent specializations. The root has oftenest <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening, but not seldom <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt> instead; and in a few cases it remains unstrengthened. Derivatives of this formation are frequent from roots with prefixes, and also in composition with other elements.\n\na. The normal and greatly prevalent accent is upon the root-syllable, without regard to the difference of meaning; but cases occur of accented final, and a few of accented penult. The action-nouns are in general of the neuter gender. The feminine of adjectives is made either in <tt>\u0101</tt> or in <tt>\u012b</tt> (for details, see below).

The more irregular formations may be classed as follows:\n\ng. With accent on the final: a number of agent-nouns and adjectives, as <tt>kara\u1e47\u00e1</tt> ''active'' (against <tt>k\u00e1ra\u1e47a</tt> ''act''), <tt>k\u1e5bpa\u1e47\u00e1</tt> ''miserable'' (against <tt>k\u1e5bp\u00e1\u1e47a</tt> ''misery''), <tt>tvara\u1e47\u00e1</tt> ''hasting'', <tt>rocan\u00e1</tt> ''shining'', <tt>kro\u00e7an\u00e1</tt> ''yelling'', <tt>svapan\u00e1</tt> ''sleepy'', <tt>k\u1e63aya\u1e47\u00e1</tt> ''habitable''.\n\nh. These, unlike the preceding class, make their feminine in <tt>\u0101</tt>: e. g. <tt>tvara\u1e47\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>spandan\u0101\u0301</tt>. A few feminine action-nouns in the older language have the same form: thus, <tt>a\u00e7an\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>asan\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>manan\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>dyotan\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>rodhan\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>\u00e7vetan\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>hasan\u0101\u0301</tt> (and compare <tt>kapan\u0101\u0301</tt>, <tt>ra\u00e7an\u0101\u0301</tt>); those of the later language in <tt>an\u0101</tt> (rather numerous) are doubtful as regards accent.\n\ni. Beside these may be mentioned a few feminines in <tt>an\u012b\u0301</tt>, of more or less doubtful character: <tt>ar\u1e63a\u1e47\u012b\u0301</tt>, <tt>cetan\u012b\u0301</tt> (to <tt>c\u00e9tana</tt>), <tt>tapan\u012b\u0301</tt> (to <tt>t\u00e1pana</tt>), <tt>p\u1e5b\u00e7an\u012b\u0301</tt>, <tt>v\u1e5bjan\u012b\u0301</tt> (with <tt>v\u1e5bj\u00e1na</tt>), <tt>rajan\u012b</tt>, <tt>tedan\u012b\u0301</tt>.\n\nj.

The only noticed example of a feminine is in <tt>\u0101</tt>: <tt>tur\u00e1\u1e47\u0101</tt>. And a few feminine nouns have the same form: <tt>arh\u00e1\u1e47\u0101</tt>, <tt>jar\u00e1\u1e47\u0101</tt>, <tt>barh\u00e1\u1e47\u0101</tt>, <tt>bhand\u00e1n\u0101</tt>, <tt>ma\u1e45h\u00e1n\u0101</tt>, <tt>meh\u00e1n\u0101</tt>, <tt>vadh\u00e1n\u0101</tt>, <tt>van\u00e1n\u0101</tt>, <tt>vak\u1e63\u00e1\u1e47\u0101</tt>.

The accent in words of the first class is on the root, and in the second on the ending; and in a few instances words of the two classes having the same form are distinguished by their accent; the infinitives have for the most part the accent on the suffix.\n\n1. b.

Apparently containing a suffix <tt>as</tt> are the noun <tt>up\u00e1s</tt> ''lap'', and certain proper names: <tt>\u00e1n\u0304giras</tt>, <tt>nodh\u00e1s</tt>, <tt>bhal\u0101n\u00e1s</tt>, <tt>arcan\u0101n\u00e1s</tt>, <tt>naciketas</tt>. The feminine <tt>apsar\u00e1s</tt> ''nymph'' is of doubtful derivation.\n\ni. The irregular formation of some of the words of this division will be noticed, without special remark.\n\n3. j. The infinitives made by the suffix <tt>as</tt> have been explained above (973): they show various treatment of the root, and various accent (which last may perhaps mark a difference of gender, like that between <tt>s\u00e1has</tt> and <tt>jar\u00e1s</tt>).\n\n4. k. The formation of derivatives in <tt>as</tt> from roots compounded with prefixes is very restricted \u2014 if, indeed, it is to be admitted at all. No infinitive in <tt>as</tt> occurs with a prefix; nor any action-noun; and the adjective combinations are in some instances evidently, and in most others apparently, possessive compounds of the noun with the prefix used adjectively: the most probable exceptions are -<tt>ny\u00f3kas</tt> and <tt>v\u00ed\u1e63pardhas</tt>. As in these examples, the accent is always on the prefix.\n\nl. Certain Vedic stems in <tt>ar</tt> may be noticed here, as more or less exchanging with stems in <tt>as</tt>, and apparently related with such. They were reported above, at 169 a.\n\nIn connection with this, the most common and important suffix ending in <tt>s</tt>, may be best treated the others, kindred in office and possibly also in origin, which end in the same sibilant.\n\n1152. \u0924\u0938\u094d <tt>tas</tt>, \u0928\u0938\u094d <tt>nas</tt>, \u0938\u0938\u094d <tt>sas</tt>. With these suffixes are made an extremely small number of action-nouns. Thus:\n\na. With <tt>tas</tt> are made <tt>r\u00e9tas</tt> ''seed'', and <tt>sr\u00f3tas</tt> ''stream''.\n\nb. With <tt>nas</tt> are made <tt>\u00e1pnas</tt> ''acquisition'', <tt>\u00e1r\u1e47as</tt> ''wave'', -<tt>bh\u00e1r\u1e47as</tt> ''offering'', <tt>r\u00e9k\u1e47as</tt> ''riches;'' and in <tt>dr\u00e1vi\u1e47as</tt> ''wealth'', and <tt>p\u00e1r\u012b\u1e47as</tt> ''fulness'' is apparently to be seen the same suffix, with prefixed elements having the present value of union-vowels. Probably the same is true of <tt>d\u00e1m\u016bnas</tt> ''house-friend'', and <tt>\u1e5b\u0301j\u016bnas</tt> (RV.) n. pr., <tt>u\u00e7\u00e1nas</tt> (or -n\u0101) n. pr.\n\nc. With <tt>sas</tt> is perhaps made <tt>v\u00e1psas</tt> ''beauty;'' and <tt>t\u00e1r\u016b\u1e63as</tt> may be mentioned with it (rather <tt>tarus</tt>-<tt>a</tt>?).<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"609289":{"pageid":609289,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/458","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>1153. \u0907\u0938\u094d <tt>is</tt>. With the suffix <tt>is</tt> is formed a small number (about a dozen) of nouns.\n\na. They are in part nouns of action, but most are used concretely. The radical syllable has the <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening, and the accent is on the suffix (except in <tt>jy\u00f3tis</tt> ''light'', <tt>vy\u00e1this</tt>, and <tt>\u0101\u0301mis</tt>, ''raw meat'').

With this suffix are made a few words, of various meaning, root-form, and accent.\n\na. They are words signifying both action and agent. A few have both meanings, without difference of accent: thus, <tt>t\u00e1pus</tt> ''heat'' and ''hot;'' <tt>\u00e1rus</tt> ''wound'' and ''sore;'' <tt>c\u00e1k\u1e63us</tt> ''brightness'' and ''seeing, eye;'' <tt>v\u00e1pus</tt> ''wonderful'' and ''wonder''. The nouns are mostly neuter, and accented on the root-syllable: thus, <tt>\u0101\u0301yus</tt>, <tt>t\u00e1rus</tt>, <tt>p\u00farus</tt>, <tt>m\u00fahus</tt> (? only adverbial), <tt>m\u00edthus</tt> (do.), <tt>y\u00e1jus</tt>, <tt>\u00e7\u0101\u0301sus</tt>; exceptions are: in regard to accent, <tt>jan\u00fas</tt> ''birth;'' in regard to gender, <tt>m\u00e1nus</tt> ''man'', and <tt>n\u00e1hus</tt>, proper name. Of adjectives, are accented on the ending <tt>jay\u00fas</tt>, <tt>van\u00fas</tt>, and <tt>dak\u1e63\u00fas</tt> ''burning'' (which appears to attach itself to the aorist-stem).\n\n1155. \u0907 <tt>i</tt>. With this suffix are formed a large body of derivatives, of all genders: adjectives and masculine agent-nouns, feminine abstracts, and a few neuters. They show a various form of the root: strong, weak, and reduplicated. Their accent is also various. Many of them have meanings much specialized; and many (including most of the neuters) are hardly to be connected with any root elsewhere demonstrable.\n\n1. a. The feminine action-nouns are of very various form: thus, with weak root-form, <tt>r\u00faci</tt> brightness, <tt>tv\u00ed\u1e63i</tt> ''sheen;'' <tt>k\u1e5b\u1e63\u00ed</tt> ''ploughing'', <tt>n\u1e5bt\u00ed</tt> ''dance;'' \u2014 with <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening (where possible), <tt>r\u00f3pi</tt> ''pain'', <tt>\u00e7oc\u00ed</tt> ''heat'', <tt>van\u00ed</tt> and <tt>san\u00ed</tt> ''gain;'' \u2014 with <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt>-strengthening, <tt>gr\u0101\u0301hi</tt> ''seizure'', <tt>dhr\u0101\u0301ji</tt> ''course'', <tt>\u0101j\u00ed</tt> ''race;'' from \u221a<tt>du\u1e63</tt> comes <tt>d\u016b\u0301\u1e63i</tt> (compare <tt>d\u016b\u1e63ayati</tt>, 1042 b). The variety of accent, which seems reducible to no rule, is illustrated by the examples given. The few infinitively used words of this formation (above, 975 b) have a weak root-form, with accent on the ending.\n\n2. b. The adjectives and masculine agent-nouns exhibit tho same variety. Thus:\n\nc. With unstrengthened root: <tt>\u00e7\u00faci</tt> ''bright'', <tt>bh\u1e5b\u0301mi</tt> ''lively'' (\u221a<tt>bhram</tt>), <tt>g\u1e5b\u0301bhi</tt> ''container''.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"609776":{"pageid":609776,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/459","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>d.

And <tt>karkar\u00ed</tt> ''lute'' and <tt>dundubh\u00ed</tt> ''drum'' have the aspect of belonging to the same class, but are probably onomatopoetic. The accent, it will be noticed, is most often on the reduplication, but not seldom elsewhere (only once on the root). It was noticed above (271 f) that these reduplicated derivatives in <tt>i</tt> not seldom take an object in the accusative, like a present participle.\n\nf. Formations in <tt>i</tt> from the root compounded with prefixes are not at all numerous. They are accented usually on the suffix. Examples arc: <tt>\u0101yaj\u00ed</tt>, <tt>vy\u0101na\u00e7\u00ed</tt>, <tt>nijaghn\u00ed</tt>, <tt>par\u0101dad\u00ed</tt>, <tt>vi\u1e63\u0101sah\u00ed</tt>; but also <tt>\u0101j\u0101\u0301ni</tt>, <tt>\u0101m\u00fari</tt>, <tt>v\u00edvavri</tt>. As compounded with other preceding words, the adjectives or agent-nouns in <tt>i</tt> are not rare, and are regularly accented on the root: see the next chapter, 1276.\n\ng. From \u221a<tt>dh\u0101</tt> comes a derivative -<tt>dhi</tt>, forming many masculine compounds, with the value both of an abstract and a concrete: thus, with prefixes, <tt>antardh\u00ed</tt>, <tt>uddh\u00ed</tt>, <tt>nidh\u00ed</tt>, <tt>paridh\u00ed</tt>, etc. From \u221a<tt>d\u0101</tt> is made in like manner <tt>\u0101di</tt> ''beginning'', and from \u221a<tt>sth\u0101</tt>, <tt>prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u00ed</tt> ''resistance''. Opinions are at variance as to whether such forms are to be regarded as made with the suffix <tt>i</tt>, displacing the radical <tt>\u0101</tt>, or with weakening of <tt>\u0101</tt> to <tt>i</tt>.\n\n3. h. Neuter nouns in <tt>i</tt> are few, and of obscure derivation: examples are <tt>\u00e1k\u1e63i</tt> ''eye'', <tt>\u00e1sthi</tt> ''bone'', <tt>d\u00e1dhi</tt> ''curds'', etc.\n\n1156. \u0908 <tt>\u012b</tt>. Stems in \u0908 <tt>\u012b</tt> (like those in \u0906 <tt>\u0101</tt>, above, 1149) are for the most part feminine adjectives, corresponding to masculines and neuters of other terminations.\n\na. Thus, feminines in <tt>\u012b</tt> are made from <tt>a</tt>-stems (332, 334: and see also the different suffixes), from <tt>i</tt>-stems (344, 346), from <tt>u</tt>-stems (344 b), from <tt>\u1e5b</tt>-stems (376 a), and from various consonant-stems (378 a).\n\nb. But there are also a few stems in <tt>\u012b</tt> wearing the aspect of independent derivatives. Examples are <tt>dak\u1e63\u012b</tt>, <tt>deh\u012b\u0301</tt>, <tt>nad\u012b\u0301</tt>, <tt>n\u0101nd\u012b\u0301</tt>, <tt>p\u00e9\u1e63\u012b</tt>,<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"610063":{"pageid":610063,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/460","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><tt>vak\u1e63\u012b\u0301</tt> (apparently with aoristic <tt>a</tt>), <tt>ve\u00e7\u012b\u0301</tt>, <tt>\u00e7\u0101\u0301k\u012b</tt>, <tt>\u00e7\u00e1c\u012b</tt>, <tt>\u00e7\u00e1m\u012b</tt>, <tt>\u00e7\u00edm\u012b</tt>, <tt>tar\u012b</tt>, <tt>v\u0101p\u012b</tt>; they are either action-nouns or agent-nouns.

The root has in general the same form as before the suffix \u0924 <tt>ta</tt> of the passive participle (952 ff.) \u2014 that is to say, a weak, and often a weakened or abbreviated, form.\n\na. The accent ought, it would appear, in analogy with that of the participle, to rest always upon the suffix; but in the recorded condition of the language it does so only in a minority of cases: namely, about fifty, against sixty cases of accent an the radical syllable, and a hundred and forty of undetermined accent; a number of words \u2014 <tt>iti</tt>, <tt>\u1e5bti</tt>, <tt>citti</tt>, <tt>t\u1e5bpti</tt>, <tt>pakti</tt>, <tt>pu\u1e63\u1e6di</tt>, <tt>bh\u016bti</tt>, <tt>bh\u1e5bti</tt>, <tt>v\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di</tt>, <tt>\u00e7akti</tt>, <tt>\u00e7ru\u1e63\u1e6di</tt>, <tt>s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di</tt>, <tt>sthiti</tt> \u2014 have both accentuations.\n\n1. b. Examples of the normal formation are: <tt>r\u0101t\u00ed</tt> ''gift'', <tt>\u016bt\u00ed</tt> ''aid'', <tt>r\u012bt\u00ed</tt> ''flow'', <tt>stut\u00ed</tt> ''praise'', <tt>bhakt\u00ed</tt> ''division'', <tt>vi\u1e63\u1e6d\u00ed</tt> ''service'', <tt>stut\u00ed</tt> ''praise'', <tt>k\u012brt\u00ed</tt> ''fame'', <tt>p\u016brt\u00ed</tt> ''bestowal'', <tt>mat\u00ed</tt> ''thought'', <tt>p\u012bt\u00ed</tt> ''drink'' (\u221a<tt>p\u0101</tt>; pple <tt>p\u012bta</tt>), <tt>dh\u0101ut\u00ed</tt> ''stream'' (\u221a<tt>dh\u0101v</tt>; pple <tt>dh\u0101uta</tt>); \u2014 and with accented root, <tt>g\u00e1ti</tt> ''motion'', <tt>\u00e7\u0101\u0301\u1e41ti</tt> ''repose'', <tt>d\u00edti</tt> ''division'' (\u221a<tt>d\u0101</tt>; pple <tt>dit\u00e1</tt>), <tt>d\u1e5b\u0301\u1e63\u1e6di</tt> ''sight'', <tt>\u00ed\u1e63\u1e6di</tt> ''offering'' (\u221a<tt>yaj</tt>: pple <tt>i\u1e63\u1e6d\u00e1</tt>), <tt>\u00fakti</tt> ''speech'' (\u221a<tt>vac</tt>: pple <tt>ukt\u00e1</tt>), <tt>v\u1e5b\u0301ddhi</tt> ''increase''.\n\nc. The roots which form their participle in <tt>ita</tt> (956) do not have the <tt>i</tt> also before <tt>ti</tt>: thus, only <tt>g\u00fapti</tt>, -<tt>d\u1e5bpti</tt>. A few roots having their participle in <tt>na</tt> instead of <tt>ta</tt> (957) form the abstract noun also in <tt>ni</tt> (below, 1158). And from the roots <tt>tan</tt> and <tt>ran</tt> occur <tt>tant\u00ed</tt> and <tt>r\u00e1nti</tt>, beside the more regular <tt>tati</tt> and <tt>r\u00e1ti</tt>; also <tt>\u00e1hanti</tt> (once; VS.) beside <tt>\u00e1hati</tt>. From roots having the form <tt>d\u0101</tt>, the derivative in composition is sometimes -<tt>tti</tt> (for <tt>d\u0101ti</tt>, with loss of radical vowel: compare the participle-form -<tt>tta</tt>, above, 955 f): thus, <tt>niravatti</tt> (K.), <tt>sampr\u00e1tti</tt> (\u00c7B.), <tt>p\u00e1ritti</tt> (TB.), <tt>v\u00e1sutti</tt>, <tt>bh\u00e1gatti</tt>, <tt>magh\u00e1tti</tt> (all RV.).\n\nd.

The ordinary intermediate <tt>i</tt> of the <tt>ta</tt>-participle etc. is seen in <tt>s\u00e1niti</tt>, <tt>ujhiti</tt>, -<tt>g\u1e5bh\u012bti</tt> (<tt>\u012b</tt>, as usual with this root: 900 b), <tt>pa\u1e6dhiti</tt>, <tt>bha\u1e47iti</tt>; and with them may be mentioned the adjective <tt>\u1e5b\u0301j\u012bti</tt>, the proper names <tt>turv\u012b\u0301ti</tt> and <tt>dabh\u012b\u0301ti</tt>, and <tt>sn\u012b\u0301hit\u012b</tt> and <tt>sn\u00e9hit\u012b</tt>, notwithstanding their long final. With <tt>ati</tt> are made a few derivatives, variously accented: thus, the action-nouns <tt>a\u1e45hat\u00ed</tt>, <tt>d\u1e5b\u00e7at\u00ed</tt>, <tt>pak\u1e63at\u00ed</tt>, <tt>mithat\u00ed</tt>, <tt>vasat\u00ed</tt>, <tt>ram\u00e1ti</tt>, <tt>vrat\u00e1ti</tt>, <tt>am\u00e1ti</tt> and <tt>\u00e1mati</tt>, -<tt>dhrajati</tt>; and the agent-words <tt>arat\u00ed</tt>, <tt>khalat\u00ed</tt>, <tt>v\u1e5bk\u00e1ti</tt>, <tt>r\u00e1mati</tt>, <tt>dahati</tt>. In some of these is to be seen with probability a stem-vowel, as also in <tt>j\u00e1nayati</tt> and <tt>rasayati</tt> (and RV. has <tt>gopay\u00e1tya</tt>). The grammarians' method of representing a root by its 3d sing. pres. indic., declining this as a <tt>ti</tt>-stem, begins in the older language: e. g. <tt>\u00e9tivant</tt> (TB.), <tt>k\u1e63etivant</tt> (AB.), <tt>yajati</tt> and <tt>juhoti</tt> and <tt>dad\u0101ti</tt> (S.), <tt>nandati</tt> (MBh.). The feminine <tt>y\u00favati</tt> ''young, maiden'' is of isolated character.\n\nh. In some of the words instanced in the last paragraph, <tt>ti</tt> is perhaps applied as a secondary suffix. A kindred character belongs to it in the numeral derivatives from pronominal roots, <tt>k\u00e1ti</tt>, <tt>t\u00e1ti</tt>, <tt>y\u00e1ti</tt>, and from numerals, as <tt>da\u00e7ati</tt>, <tt>vi\u1e45\u00e7at\u00ed</tt>, <tt>\u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6d\u00ed</tt>, etc., with <tt>pan\u0304kt\u00ed</tt> (from <tt>p\u00e1\u00f1ca</tt>); in <tt>pad\u0101ti</tt>; and in <tt>addh\u0101t\u00ed</tt>, from the particle <tt>addh\u0101\u0301</tt>.\n\n1158. \u0928\u093f <tt>ni</tt>. This suffix agrees in general in its uses and in the form of its derivatives with the preceding; but it makes a very much smaller number of words, among which the feminine abstracts are a minority.\n\na. As was noticed above (1157 c), a few verbs (ending in vowels) making their passive participle in <tt>na</tt> instead of <tt>ta</tt> make their action-noun in <tt>ni</tt> instead of <tt>ti</tt>. From the older language are quotable <tt>jy\u0101n\u00ed</tt> ''injury'', <tt>j\u016brn\u00ed</tt> ''heat'', <tt>h\u0101ni</tt> ''abandonment'' (and the masculines <tt>gh\u1e5b\u0301\u1e47i</tt> and <tt>j\u012b\u0301r\u1e47i</tt>); later occur <tt>gl\u0101ni</tt>, -<tt>ml\u0101ni</tt>, <tt>sanni</tt>-.\n\nb. Words of the other class are: <tt>a\u00e7ni</tt> ''eating'', -<tt>u\u1e63\u1e47i</tt> ''burning'', <tt>v\u00e1hni</tt> ''carrying'', <tt>j\u016b\u0301r\u1e47i</tt> ''singing'', <tt>t\u016b\u0301r\u1e47i</tt> ''hasty'', <tt>bh\u016b\u0301r\u1e47i</tt> ''excited'', <tt>dhar\u1e47\u00ed</tt> ''sustaining'', <tt>pre\u1e47\u00ed</tt> ''loving'', <tt>v\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u00ed</tt> and <tt>v\u1e5b\u0301\u1e63\u1e47i</tt> ''virile;'' and with them may be mentioned <tt>p\u1e5b\u0301\u00e7ni</tt> ''speckled''.\n\nc. In <tt>pre\u1e47\u00ed</tt>, <tt>y\u00f3ni</tt>, <tt>men\u00ed</tt>, <tt>\u00e7r\u00e9\u1e47i</tt>, <tt>\u00e7r\u00f3\u1e47i</tt> is seen a strengthening of the radical syllable, such as does not appear among the derivatives in <tt>ti</tt>.\n\nd.

The words made by this suffix have the same double value with those made by the preceding suffixes. Their accent is various. Thus:\n\na.

From a reduplicated root-form comes -<tt>paptani</tt>. From desiderative stems are made <tt>ruruk\u1e63\u00e1\u1e47i</tt>, <tt>si\u1e63\u0101s\u00e1ni</tt>, and (with prefix) <tt>\u0101-\u00e7u\u00e7uk\u1e63\u00e1\u1e47i</tt>. And a small number of words appear to attach themselves to an <tt>s</tt>-aorist stem: thus, <tt>par\u1e63\u00e1\u1e47i</tt>, <tt>sak\u1e63\u00e1\u1e47i</tt>, <tt>car\u1e63a\u1e47\u00ed</tt>.\n\nc.

Not many words are made with a suffix of this form, and of these few are plainly to be connected with roots. Certain rare neuters (along with the doubtful infinitives) are nouns of action; the rest are masculine and neuter agent-nouns. The accent is various.\n\na. The infinitives which admit of being referred to this suffix, as locative cases, are those in <tt>\u1e63\u00e1\u1e47i</tt>, of which the sibilant may be the final of a tense-stem.

The great mass of the words of this formation are the infinitives \u2014 accusatives in the later language, in the earlier likewise datives and ablative-genitives: see above, 970 b, 972, But a few are also used independently, as action-nouns or with concreted meaning; and an extremely small number, of somewhat questionable character, appear to have the value of agent-words. They are of all genders, but chiefly masculine. The root has the <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening.\n\na. The infinitive words are accented on the radical syllable when simple, and most of the others have the same accent; but a few have the tone on the ending.\n\nb.

Agent-nouns appear to be <tt>dh\u0101\u0301tu</tt> ''drinkable'' and <tt>kro\u1e63\u1e6du</tt> ''jackal''.\n\nc. The infinitives in <tt>tu</tt> have (968) often the union-vowel <tt>i</tt> before the suffix, and this in a few cases is lengthened to <tt>\u012b</tt>. In other use occur also -<tt>st\u00e1r\u012btu</tt> and -<tt>dh\u00e1r\u012btu</tt> (both with <tt>dus</tt>), -<tt>h\u00e1v\u012btu</tt> (with <tt>su</tt>); <tt>turph\u00e1r\u012btu</tt> seems of the same formation, but is obscure.\n\nd. In a few instances, the suffix <tt>tu</tt> appears to be added to a tense- or conjugation-stem in <tt>a</tt>; thus, <tt>edhat\u00fa</tt> and <tt>vahat\u00fa</tt>; <tt>tamyat\u00fa</tt> and <tt>tapyat\u00fa</tt>; and <tt>si\u1e63\u0101s\u00e1tu</tt>. The accent of the last is paralleled only by that of <tt>j\u012bv\u0101\u0301tu</tt> ''life'', which is further exceptional in showing a long <tt>\u0101</tt>; it is used sometimes in the manner of an infinitive.\n\n1162. \u0928\u0941 <tt>nu</tt>. This suffix forms a comparatively small body of words, generally masculine, and having both the abstract and the concrete value.\n\na.

A few examples of combination with prefixes occur, with accent on the final: thus, <tt>nir\u1e5bth\u00e1</tt> ''destruction'', <tt>sa\u1e41gath\u00e1</tt> ''union'', etc.\n\nc. Still more common in the older language is a form of this suffix to which has become prefixed an <tt>\u00e1</tt>, which is probably of thematic origin, though become a union-vowel. Thus: -<tt>an\u00e1tha</tt> ''breathing'', <tt>ay\u00e1tha</tt> ''foot'', <tt>car\u00e1tha</tt> ''mobility'', <tt>tve\u1e63\u00e1tha</tt> ''vehemence'', and so <tt>proth\u00e1tha</tt>, <tt>yaj\u00e1tha</tt>, <tt>rav\u00e1tha</tt>, <tt>vak\u1e63\u00e1tha</tt>, <tt>uc\u00e1tha</tt>, <tt>vid\u00e1tha</tt>, <tt>\u00e7a\u1e45satha</tt>, <tt>\u00e7ap\u00e1tha</tt>, <tt>\u00e7ay\u00e1tha</tt>, <tt>\u00e7vay\u00e1tha</tt>, <tt>\u00e7vas\u00e1tha</tt>, <tt>sac\u00e1tha</tt>, <tt>stan\u00e1tha</tt>, <tt>stav\u00e1tha</tt>, <tt>srav\u00e1tha</tt>, and, with weak root-form, <tt>ruv\u00e1tha</tt>; the later language adds <tt>karatha</tt>, <tt>taratha</tt>, <tt>\u00e7amatha</tt>, <tt>savatha</tt>. With a prefix, the accent is thrown forward upon the final: thus, <tt>\u0101vasath\u00e1</tt> ''abode'', <tt>pravasath\u00e1</tt> ''absence;'' but <tt>pr\u0101\u1e47\u00e1tha</tt> ''breath'' is treated as if pr\u0101n were an integral root.\n\nd.

For other derivatives ending in <tt>yu</tt>, see the suffix <tt>u</tt>, below, 1178 h, i.\n\n1166. \u092e <tt>ma</tt>. The action-nouns made by this suffix are almost all masculine; and they are of various root-form and accent, as are also the agent-nouns and adjectives.\n\na. Examples of action-nouns are: <tt>ajm\u00e1</tt> ''course'', <tt>gharm\u00e1<tt> ''heat;'' <tt>\u00e9ma</tt> ''progress'', <tt>bh\u0101\u0301ma</tt> ''brightness'', <tt>s\u00e1rna</tt> ''flow'', <tt>st\u00f3ma</tt> ''song of praise''.\n\nb. Examples of agent-nouns etc. are: <tt>tigm\u00e1</tt> ''sharp'', <tt>bh\u012bm\u00e1</tt> ''terrible'', <tt>\u00e7agm\u00e1</tt> ''mighty'', <tt>idhm\u00e1</tt> ''fuel'', <tt>yudhm\u00e1</tt> ''warrior''. A single instance from a reduplicated root is <tt>t\u016btum\u00e1</tt> ''powerful''. <tt>Sar\u00e1m\u0101</tt> f., with <tt>a</tt> before the suffix, is of doubtful connection.\n\nc. A number of stems in <tt>ma</tt> have stems in <tt>man</tt> beside them, and appear, at least in part, to be transfers from the <tt>an</tt>- to the <tt>a</tt>-declension. Such are <tt>ajma</tt>, <tt>oma</tt>, <tt>ema</tt>, <tt>arma</tt>, <tt>t\u00f3kma</tt>, <tt>darm\u00e1</tt>, <tt>dh\u00e1rma</tt>, <tt>narm\u00e1</tt>, <tt>y\u0101\u0301ma</tt>, <tt>yugma</tt>, <tt>vema</tt>, <tt>\u00e7u\u1e63ma</tt>, <tt>s\u00f3ma</tt>, <tt>s\u00e1rma</tt>, <tt>h\u00f3ma</tt>.\n\n1167. \u092e\u093f <tt>mi</tt>. A very small number of nouns, masculine and feminine, formed with <tt>mi</tt>, may be conveniently noticed here.\n\nThus, from <tt>\u1e5b</tt>-roots, <tt>\u016brm\u00ed</tt> ''wave'', -<tt>k\u016brmi</tt> ''action'', <tt>s\u016brm\u012b\u0301</tt> f.

RV., once).\n\n1168. \u092e\u0928\u094d <tt>man</tt>. The numerous derivatives made with this suffix are almost only action-nouns. The great majority of them are neuter, and accented on the root-syllable; a much smaller number are masculine, and accented on the suffix. The few agent-words are, if nouns, masculine, and have the latter accent: in several instances, a neuter and a masculine, of the one and the other value and accent, stand side by side. The root has in general the <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening.\n\n1. a. Examples of regularly formed neuters are: <tt>k\u00e1rman</tt> ''action'', <tt>j\u00e1nman</tt> ''birth'', <tt>n\u0101\u0301man</tt> ''name'', <tt>v\u00e1rtman</tt> ''track'', <tt>v\u00e9\u00e7man</tt> ''dwelling'', <tt>h\u00f3man</tt> ''sacrifice'', -<tt>dy\u00f3tman</tt> ''splendor''.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"612182":{"pageid":612182,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/466","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\nb.

Corresponding neuter action-nouns and masculine agent-nouns are: <tt>br\u00e1hman</tt> ''worship'' and <tt>brahm\u00e1n</tt> ''priest;'' <tt>d\u0101\u0301man</tt> ''gift'' and <tt>d\u0101m\u00e1n</tt> ''giver;'' <tt>dh\u00e1rman</tt> ''rule'' and <tt>dharm\u00e1n</tt> ''orderer;'' <tt>s\u00e1dman</tt> ''seat'' and <tt>sadm\u00e1n</tt> ''sitter''. But <tt>\u00f3man</tt> ''friend'' stands in the contrary relation to <tt>om\u00e1n</tt> m. ''favor''. Very few other agent-nouns occur; and all, except <tt>brahm\u00e1n</tt>, are of rare occurrence.\n\nd. On the other hand, <tt>jeman</tt> and <tt>var\u1e63man</tt> and <tt>sv\u0101dman</tt> (and <tt>variman</tt>) have the difference of gender and accent without a corresponding difference of meaning.\n\ne. The noun <tt>\u00e1\u00e7man</tt> ''stone'', though masculine, is accented on the radical syllable; and two or three other questionable cases of the same kind occur.\n\nf. The derivatives in <tt>man</tt> used as infinitives (974) have for the most part the accent of neuters: the only exception is <tt>vidm\u00e1ne</tt>.\n\ng. A few words, of either class, have an irregular root-form: thus, <tt>\u00fadman</tt>, <tt>\u016b\u1e63m\u00e1n</tt> or <tt>u\u1e63man</tt>, <tt>bh\u016b\u0301man</tt> ''earth'', <tt>bh\u016bm\u00e1n</tt> ''abundance'', <tt>sy\u016b\u0301man</tt>, <tt>s\u012bm\u00e1n</tt>, <tt>bhujm\u00e1n</tt>, <tt>vidm\u00e1n</tt>, <tt>\u00e7\u00edkman</tt>, <tt>\u00e7u\u1e63man</tt>, <tt>sidhman</tt>; and <tt>k\u0101\u0301r\u1e63man</tt>, <tt>bh\u0101\u0301rman</tt>, <tt>\u00e7\u0101\u0301kman</tt>.\n\nh. Derivatives in <tt>man</tt> from roots with prefixes are not numerous. They are usually accented on the prefix, whether action-nouns or adjectives: thus, <tt>pr\u00e1bharman</tt> ''forthbringing'', <tt>pr\u00e1y\u00e1man</tt> ''departure;'' <tt>\u00e1nuvartman</tt> ''following after:'' the exceptions, <tt>vij\u0101\u0301man</tt>, <tt>prativartm\u00e1n</tt>, <tt>visarm\u00e1n</tt>, are perhaps of possessive formation.\n\n2. i. The same suffix, though only with its abstract-making value, has in a number of cases before it a union-vowel, <tt>i</tt> or <tt>\u012b</tt>; and <tt>im\u00e1n</tt> comes to be used as a secondary suffix, forming abstract nouns (masculine) from a considerable number of adjectives.\n\nj. The neuters in <tt>iman</tt> and <tt>\u012bman</tt> are primary formations, belonging almost only to the older language: thus, <tt>j\u00e1niman</tt>, <tt>dhariman</tt> (M.), <tt>v\u00e1riman</tt> (beside <tt>varim\u00e1n</tt>, as noticed above); and <tt>d\u00e1r\u012bman</tt>, <tt>dh\u00e1r\u012bman</tt>, <tt>p\u00e1r\u012bman</tt> (and <tt>p\u00e1reman</tt> SV., once), <tt>bh\u00e1r\u012bman</tt>, <tt>v\u00e1r\u012bman</tt>, <tt>s\u00e1r\u012bman</tt>, <tt>st\u00e1r\u012bman</tt>, <tt>s\u00e1v\u012bman</tt>, and <tt>h\u00e1v\u012bman</tt>. Those in <tt>\u012bman</tt> are hardly met with outside the Rig-Veda.\n\nk. The masculines in <tt>im\u00e1n</tt> are in the oldest language less frequent than the neuters just described: they are <tt>t\u00e1niman</tt> (?), <tt>jarim\u00e1n</tt>, <tt>prathim\u00e1n</tt>, <tt>mahim\u00e1n</tt>, <tt>varim\u00e1n</tt> (beside the equivalent <tt>v\u00e1riman</tt> and <tt>v\u00e1r\u012bman</tt>), <tt>var\u1e63im\u00e1n</tt> (beside the equivalent <tt>v\u00e1r\u1e63man</tt> and <tt>var\u1e63m\u00e1n</tt>), <tt>harim\u00e1n</tt>, and <tt>dr\u0101ghim\u00e1n</tt> (VS.) beside <tt>dr\u0101ghm\u00e1n</tt> (V.B.).

By this suffix are made almost only agent-words, adjectives and nouns, the latter chiefly masculines. The root is unstrengthened, and to a short final vowel is added a \u0924\u094d <tt>t</tt> before the suffix. The accent is almost always on the root, both in the simple words and in their compounds.\n\na. The insertion of <tt>t</tt> is an intimation that the words of this form are originally made by the addition of <tt>an</tt> to derivatives in <tt>u</tt> and <tt>tu</tt>; yet <tt>van</tt> has the present value of an integral suffix in the language, and must be treated as such.\n\nb. Examples of the usual formation are: masc. <tt>y\u00e1jvan</tt> ''offering'', <tt>dr\u00fahvan</tt> ''harming'', <tt>\u00e7\u00e1kvan</tt> ''capable'', -<tt>r\u00edkvan</tt> ''leaving'', -<tt>j\u00edtvan</tt> ''conquering'', <tt>s\u00fatvan</tt> ''pressing'', <tt>k\u1e5b\u0301tvan</tt> ''active'', -<tt>g\u00e1tvan</tt> (like -<tt>gat</tt>, -<tt>gatya</tt>) ''going'', <tt>s\u00e1tvan</tt> (\u221a<tt>san</tt>) ''warrior;'' neut. <tt>p\u00e1rvan</tt> ''joint'', <tt>dh\u00e1nvan</tt> ''bow''.

VS.) and <tt>vidv\u00e1n</tt> (? AV.).\n\nc. Examples from roots with prefixes (which are not rare) are: <tt>at\u012btvan</tt> ''excelling'', <tt>upah\u00e1svan</tt> ''reviler'', <tt>sambh\u1e5b\u0301tvan</tt> ''collecting;'' and perhaps <tt>viv\u00e1svan</tt> ''shining:'' <tt>abh\u00edsatvan</tt> is a compound with governing preposition (1310). For the compounds with other elements, which, except in special cases, have the same accent, see below, 1277.\n\nd. The stems <tt>mu\u1e63\u012bv\u00e1n</tt> ''robber'' and <tt>san\u00edtvan</tt> (each RV., once) are the only ones with a union-vowel, and are perhaps better regarded as secondary derivatives \u2014 of which a few are made with this suffix: see below, 1234.

Much more common are the feminine stems in \u0935\u0930\u0940 <tt>var\u012b</tt>, which, from the earliest period, serve as corresponding feminines to the masculine stems in \u0935\u0928\u094d <tt>van</tt>.\n\na.

The feminines in <tt>var\u012b</tt> accord in treatment of the root and in accent with the masculines in <tt>van</tt> to which they correspond: thus, <tt>y\u00e1jvar\u012b</tt>, -<tt>j\u00edtvar\u012b</tt>, <tt>s\u1e5b\u0301tvar\u012b</tt>, -<tt>\u00e7\u012b\u0301var\u012b</tt>, -<tt>y\u0101var\u012b</tt>, and so on (about twenty-five such formations in RV.); from a reduplicated root, -<tt>\u00e7i\u00e7var\u012b</tt>.\n\nc. A very small number of neuters occur, with accent on the root: thus, <tt>k\u00e1rvara</tt> ''deed'', <tt>g\u00e1hvara</tt> (later also <tt>gabhvara</tt>) ''thicket;'' and a feminine or two, with accent on the penult: <tt>urv\u00e1r\u0101</tt> ''field'', and <tt>urv\u00e1r\u012b</tt> ''tow'' (both of doubtful etymology).\n\nWe take up now the suffixes by which are made only stems having the value of agent-nouns and adjectives; beginning with a brief mention of the participial endings, which in general have been already sufficiently treated.\n\n1172. \u0905\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d <tt>ant</tt> (or \u0905\u0924\u094d <tt>at</tt>).

A few general adjectives, or nouns with concrete meaning, are adaptations of this participle. Examples are: <tt>t\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u00e1</tt> ''rough'', <tt>\u00e7\u012bt\u00e1</tt> ''cold'', <tt>d\u1e5b\u1e0dh\u00e1</tt> (for <tt>d\u1e5d\u1e0dh\u00e1</tt>: 224 a) ''firm;'' <tt>d\u016bt\u00e1</tt> ''messenger'', <tt>s\u016bt\u00e1</tt> ''charioteer;'' <tt>\u1e5bt\u00e1</tt> ''right'', <tt>g\u1e25\u1e5bt\u00e1</tt> ''ghee'', <tt>j\u0101t\u00e1</tt> ''kind'', <tt>dy\u016bt\u00e1</tt> ''gambling'', <tt>n\u1e5btt\u00e1</tt> ''dance'', <tt>j\u012bvit\u00e1</tt> ''life'', <tt>carit\u00e1</tt> ''behavior'', <tt>smita</tt> ''smile''. The adjective <tt>tigit\u00e1</tt> (RV.) ''sharp'' shows anomalous reversion of palatal to guttural before the <tt>i</tt> (216 d). <tt>V\u0101v\u0101\u0301ta</tt> ''dear'' is a single example from a reduplicated root.\n\nb. Doubtless after the example and model of participles from denominative stems (of which, however, no instances are quotable from the Veda \u2014 unless <tt>bh\u0101mita</tt> RV.), derivatives in <tt>ita</tt> are in the later language made directly from noun and adjective-stems, having the meaning of ''endowed with, affected by, made to be'', and the like (compare the similar English formation in ''ed'', as ''horned'', ''barefooted'', ''bluecoated''). Examples are <tt>rathita</tt> ''furnished with a chariot'', <tt>du\u1e25khita</tt> ''pained'', <tt>kusumita</tt> ''flowered'', <tt>durbalita</tt> ''weakened'', <tt>ni\u1e25sa\u1e41\u00e7ayita</tt> ''indubitable'', etc. etc.\n\nc. A few words ending in <tt>ta</tt> are accented on the radical syllable, and their relation to the participial derivatives is very doubtful: such are <tt>\u00e1sta</tt> ''home'', <tt>m\u00e1rta</tt> ''mortal'', <tt>v\u0101\u0301ta</tt> ''wind;'' and with them may be mentioned <tt>g\u00e1rta</tt> ''high seat'', <tt>n\u00e1kta</tt> ''night'', <tt>h\u00e1sta</tt> ''hand''. <tt>Vrat\u00e1</tt> is commonly viewed as containing a suffix <tt>ta</tt>, but it doubtless comes from \u221a<tt>v\u1e5bt</tt> (<tt>vrat</tt>-<tt>\u00e1</tt>, like <tt>trad\u00e1</tt>, <tt>vraj\u00e1</tt>) and means originally ''course''.\n\nd. Several adjectives denoting color end in <tt>ita</tt>, but are hardly connectible with roots of kindred meaning: thus, <tt>palit\u00e1</tt> ''gray'', <tt>\u00e1sita</tt> ''black'', <tt>r\u00f3hita</tt> and <tt>l\u00f3hita</tt> ''red'', <tt>h\u00e1rita</tt> ''green;'' akin with them are <tt>\u00e9ta</tt> ''variegated'', <tt>\u00e7yet\u00e1</tt> ''white''. The feminines of these stems are in part irregular: thus, <tt>\u00e9n\u012b</tt> and <tt>\u00e7y\u00e9n\u012b</tt>; <tt>r\u00f3hi\u1e47\u012b</tt> and <tt>l\u00f3hin\u012b</tt>, and <tt>h\u00e1ri\u1e47\u012b</tt> (but the corresponding masc. <tt>h\u00e1ri\u1e47a</tt> also occurs); and <tt>\u00e1sikn\u012b</tt>, <tt>p\u00e1likn\u012b</tt>, and <tt>h\u00e1rikn\u012b</tt>.\n\ne. A small number of adjectives in the older language ending in <tt>ata</tt> are not to be separated from the participial words in <tt>ta</tt>, although their specific meaning is in part gerundive. They are: <tt>pacat\u00e1</tt> ''cooked'', <tt>dar\u00e7at\u00e1</tt> and <tt>pa\u00e7yata</tt> ''seen, to be seen, worth seeing;'' and so <tt>yajat\u00e1</tt>, <tt>haryat\u00e1</tt>, <tt>bharat\u00e1</tt>. The <tt>y</tt> of <tt>pa\u00e7yata</tt> and <tt>haryat\u00e1</tt> indicates pretty plainly that the <tt>a</tt> also is that of a present tense-stem. <tt>Rajat\u00e1</tt> ''silvery'' is of more obscure relation to \u221a<tt>raj</tt> ''color;'' <tt>p\u00e1rvata</tt> ''mountain'' must be secondary.\n\n1177. \u0928 <tt>na</tt> (and \u0907\u0928 <tt>ina</tt>, \u0909\u0928 <tt>una</tt>). The use of the suffix \u0928 <tt>na</tt> in forming from certain roots participles equivalent to those in \u0924 <tt>ta</tt>, either alongside the latter or instead of them, was explained above, at 957.\n\na.

The few words ending in <tt>ina</tt> are of doubtful connection, but may be mentioned here: thus, <tt>amin\u00e1</tt> ''violent'', <tt>v\u1e5bjin\u00e1</tt> ''crooked'', <tt>d\u00e1k\u1e63i\u1e47a</tt> ''right'', <tt>dr\u00e1vi\u1e47a</tt> ''property'', <tt>druhi\u1e47a</tt>, <tt>\u00e7re\u1e63i\u1e47a</tt>, <tt>hari\u1e47\u00e1</tt>; and <tt>kan\u012b\u0301na</tt> may be added.\n\nc. The words ending in <tt>una</tt> are of various meaning and accent, like those in <tt>ana</tt>: they are <tt>\u00e1rjuna</tt>, <tt>kar\u00fa\u1e47a</tt>, -<tt>cet\u00fana</tt>, <tt>t\u00e1ru\u1e47a</tt>, <tt>d\u0101ru\u1e47\u00e1</tt>, <tt>dhar\u00fa\u1e47a</tt>, <tt>nar\u00fa\u1e47a</tt>, <tt>p\u00ed\u00e7una</tt>, <tt>mithun\u00e1</tt>, <tt>yat\u00fana</tt>, <tt>vay\u00fana</tt>, <tt>varu\u1e47a</tt>, <tt>\u00e7al\u00fana</tt>, and the feminine <tt>yam\u00fan\u0101</tt>; and <tt>bhr\u016b\u1e47\u00e1</tt> may be added.\n\nd. These are all the proper participial endings of the language. The gerundives, later and earlier, are in the main evident secondary formations, and will be treated under the head of secondary derivation.\n\nWe take up now the other suffixes forming agent-nouns and adjectives, beginning with those which have more or less a participial value.\n\n1178. \u0909 <tt>u</tt>. With this suffix are made a considerable body of derivatives, of very various character \u2014 adjectives, and agent-nouns of all genders, with different treatment of the root, and with different accent. It is especially used with certain conjugational stems, desiderative (particularly later) and denominative (mainly earlier), making adjectives with the value of present participles; and in such use it wins in part the aspect of a secondary suffix.\n\na. The root has oftenest a weak (or weakened) form; but it is sometimes vriddhied; least often (when capable of <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>), it has the <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening \u2014 all without any apparent connection with either accent or meaning or gender. After final radical <tt>\u0101</tt> is usually added <tt>y</tt> (258) before the suffix. A few derivatives are made from the reduplicated root. But many words ending in <tt>u</tt> are not readily, or not at all, connectible with roots; examples will be given especially of those that have an obvious etymology.\n\nb. Examples of ordinary adjectives are: <tt>ur\u00fa</tt> ''wide'', <tt>\u1e5bj\u00fa</tt> ''straight'', <tt>p\u1e5bth\u00fa</tt> ''broad'', <tt>m\u1e5bd\u00fa</tt> ''soft'', <tt>s\u0101dh\u00fa</tt> ''good'', <tt>sv\u0101d\u00fa</tt> ''sweet'', <tt>t\u00e1pu</tt> ''hot'', <tt>v\u00e1su</tt> ''good;'' <tt>j\u0101y\u00fa</tt> ''conquering'', <tt>d\u0101r\u00fa</tt> ''bursting;'' <tt>\u00e7ay\u00fa</tt> ''lying'', <tt>r\u00e9ku</tt> ''empty;'' <tt>dh\u0101y\u00fa</tt> ''thirsty'', <tt>p\u0101y\u00fa</tt> ''protecting''.

A few derivatives are made from roots with prefixes, with various accentuation: for example, <tt>up\u0101y\u00fa</tt> ''on-coming'', <tt>pramay\u00fa</tt> ''going to destruction'', <tt>vikl\u00edndu</tt> a certain disease, <tt>abh\u012b\u0301\u00e7u</tt> ''rein (director)'', <tt>s\u00e1\u1e41vasu</tt> ''dwelling together''.\n\nf. From tense-stems, apparently, are made <tt>tany\u00fa</tt> ''thundering'', <tt>bhind\u00fa</tt> ''splitting'', -<tt>vindu</tt> ''finding'', and (with aoristic <tt>s</tt>) <tt>d\u00e1k\u1e63u</tt> and <tt>dh\u00e1k\u1e63u</tt> (all RV.).\n\ng. Participial adjectives in <tt>\u00fa</tt> from desiderative \"roots\" (stems with loss of their final <tt>a</tt>) are sufficiently numerous in the ancient language (RV. has more than a dozen of them, AV. not quite so many) to show that the formation was already a regular one, extensible at will; and later such adjectives may be made from every desiderative. Examples (older) are: <tt>dits\u00fa</tt>, <tt>dips\u00fa</tt>, <tt>cikits\u00fa</tt>, <tt>titik\u1e63\u00fa</tt>, <tt>pip\u012b\u1e63u</tt>, <tt>mumuk\u1e63\u00fa</tt>, <tt>iyak\u1e63\u00fa</tt>, <tt>\u00e7i\u00e7lik\u1e63\u00fa</tt>; with prefix, <tt>abhidips\u00fa</tt>; with anomalous accent, <tt>did\u1e5b\u0301k\u1e63u</tt>. These adjectives, both earlier and later, may take an object in the accusative (271 a).\n\nh. A few similar adjectives are made in the older language from causatives: thus, <tt>dh\u0101ray\u00fa</tt> (persistent), <tt>bh\u0101jay\u00fa</tt>, <tt>bh\u0101vay\u00fa</tt>, <tt>ma\u1e45hay\u00fa</tt>, <tt>manday\u00fa</tt>, <tt>\u00e7ramay\u00fa</tt>; and <tt>m\u1e5bgay\u00fa</tt> from the caus.-denom. <tt>m\u1e5bg\u00e1ya</tt>.\n\ni. Much more numerous, however, are such formations from the more proper denominatives, especially in the oldest language (RV. has toward eighty of them; AV. only a quarter as many, including six or eight which are not found in RV.; and they are still rarer in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and hardly met with later). In a majority of cases, personal verbal forms from the same denominative stem are in use: thus, for example, to <tt>agh\u0101y\u00fa</tt>, <tt>ar\u0101t\u012by\u00fa</tt>, <tt>\u1e5bj\u016by\u00fa</tt>, <tt>cara\u1e47y\u00fa</tt>, <tt>manasy\u00fa</tt>, <tt>sani\u1e63y\u00fa</tt>, <tt>uru\u1e63y\u00fa</tt>, <tt>sapary\u00fa</tt>; in others, only the present participle in <tt>y\u00e1nt</tt>, or the abstract noun in <tt>y\u0101\u0301</tt> (1149 d), or nothing at all. A few are made upon denominative stems from pronouns: thus, <tt>tv\u0101y\u00fa</tt> (beside <tt>tv\u0101y\u00e1nt</tt> and <tt>tv\u0101y\u0101\u0301</tt>), <tt>yuvay\u00fa</tt> or <tt>yuv\u0101y\u00fa</tt>, <tt>asmay\u00fa</tt>, <tt>svay\u00fa</tt>, and the more anomalous <tt>aha\u1e41y\u00fa</tt> and <tt>ki\u1e41y\u00fa</tt>. Especially where no other denominative forms accompany the adjective, this has often the aspect of being made directly from the noun with the suffix <tt>yu</tt>, either with a meaning of ''seeking'' or ''desiring'', or with a more general adjective sense: thus, <tt>yavay\u00fa</tt> ''seeking grain'', <tt>var\u0101hay\u00fa</tt> ''boar-hunting'', <tt>stanasy\u00fa</tt> ''desiring the breast;'' <tt>\u016br\u1e47\u0101y\u00fa</tt> ''woolen'', <tt>yuvany\u00fa</tt> ''youthful'', <tt>bh\u012bmay\u00fa</tt> ''terrible''. And so the \"secondary suffix <tt>yu</tt>\" wins a degree of standing and application as one forming derivative adjectives (as in <tt>aha\u1e41y\u00fa</tt> and <tt>ki\u1e41y\u00fa</tt>, above, and doubtless some others, even of the RV. words). In three RV. cases, the final <tt>as</tt> of a noun-stem is even changed to <tt>o</tt> before it: namely, <tt>a\u1e45hoy\u00fa</tt>, <tt>duvoy\u00fa</tt> (and <tt>duvoy\u0101\u0301</tt>; beside <tt>duvasy\u00fa</tt>), <tt>\u00e1sk\u1e5bdhoyu</tt>.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"614655":{"pageid":614655,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/473","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>j.

In all probability, they are originally and properly obtained by adding the secondary suffix <tt>ka</tt> (1222) to a derivative in <tt>u</tt>; but they have gained fully the character of primary formations, and in only an instance or two is there found in actual use an <tt>u</tt>-word from which they should be made.\n\nb. The root is only so far strengthened that the radical syllable is a heavy (79) one; and it has the accent, whether the derivative is made from a simple root or from one with prefix.\n\nc.

Here, as in the preceding case, we doubtless have a suffix made by secondary addition of \u0915 <tt>ka</tt> to a derivative in \u0905 <tt>a</tt>; but it has, for the same reason as the other, a right to be mentioned here. Its free use in the manner of a primary suffix is of still later date than that of <tt>uka</tt>; it has very few examples in the older language.\n\na.

The accent, in the older language, is sometimes on the suffix and sometimes on the root; or, from roots combined with prefixes, sometimes on the suffix and sometimes on the prefix.\n\nd. In general, the accent on the root or prefix accompanies the participial use of the word; but there are exceptions to this: in a very few instances (four), a word with accented suffix has an accusative object; very much more often, accent on the root appears along with ordinary noun value. The accent, as well as the form, of <tt>man\u00f3t\u1e5b</tt> is an isolated irregularity. Examples are: <tt>j\u00e9t\u0101 dh\u00e1n\u0101ni</tt> ''winning treasures;'' <tt>y\u016by\u00e1m m\u00e1rta\u1e41 \u00e7r\u00f3t\u0101ra\u1e25</tt> ''ye listen to a mortal;'' but, on the other hand, <tt>ya\u1e41t\u0101\u0301 v\u00e1s\u016bni vidhat\u00e9</tt> ''bestowing good things on the pious;'' and <tt>j\u00e9t\u0101 j\u00e1n\u0101n\u0101m</tt> ''conqueror of peoples''.\n\ne. The formation of these nouns in <tt>t\u1e5b</tt> from conjugation-stems, regular and frequent in the later language, and not very rare in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, is met with but once or twice in the Veda (<tt>bodhayit\u1e5b\u0301</tt> and <tt>codayitr\u012b\u0301</tt>, RV.). In <tt>n\u00e9\u1e63\u1e6d\u1e5b</tt> a certain priest (RV. and later), is apparently seen the aoristic <tt>s</tt>.\n\nf. The words of relationship which, in whatever way, have gained the aspect of derivatives in <tt>t\u1e5b</tt>, are <tt>pit\u1e5b\u0301</tt>, <tt>m\u0101t\u1e5b\u0301</tt>, <tt>bhr\u0101\u0301t\u1e5b</tt>, <tt>y\u0101\u0301t\u1e5b</tt>, <tt>duhit\u1e5b\u0301</tt>, <tt>n\u00e1pt\u1e5b</tt>, <tt>j\u0101\u0301m\u0101t\u1e5b</tt>.

Feminines (in <tt>tr\u0101</tt>) are: <tt>\u00e1\u1e63\u1e6dr\u0101</tt> ''goad'', <tt>m\u0101\u0301tr\u0101</tt> ''measure'', <tt>h\u00f3tr\u0101</tt> ''sacrifice'' (beside <tt>hotr\u00e1</tt>), <tt>da\u1e45\u1e63\u1e6dr\u0101</tt> (later, for <tt>d\u00e1\u1e45\u1e63\u1e6dra</tt>); <tt>n\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dr\u0101\u0301</tt> ''destroyer''.\n\ne. Not seldom, a \"union-vowel\" appears before the suffix; but this is not usually the equivalent of the union-vowel used with <tt>t\u1e5b</tt> (above, 1182 a). For the words in <tt>itra</tt> have the accent on <tt>i</tt>: thus, <tt>ar\u00edtra</tt> (<tt>\u00e1ritra</tt> AV., once) ''impelling, oar'', <tt>khan\u00edtra</tt> ''shovel'', <tt>pav\u00edtra</tt> ''sieve'', <tt>jan\u00edtra</tt> ''birth-place'', <tt>san\u00edtra</tt> ''gift;'' and so -<tt>avitra</tt>, <tt>a\u00e7\u00edtra</tt>, <tt>car\u00edtra</tt>, -<tt>taritra</tt>, <tt>dhamitra</tt>, <tt>dhav\u00edtra</tt>, <tt>bhav\u00edtra</tt>, <tt>bhar\u00edtra</tt>, <tt>v\u0101ditra</tt> (with causative root-strengthening), <tt>vahitra</tt>: the combination <tt>\u00edtra</tt> has almost won the character of an independent suffix. The preceding vowel is also in a few cases <tt>a</tt> (sometimes apparently of the present-stem): thus, <tt>y\u00e1jatra</tt> ''venerable'', <tt>k\u1e5bnt\u00e1tra</tt> ''shred'', <tt>g\u0101yatr\u00e1</tt> (f. -<tt>tr\u012b\u0301</tt>) ''song'', -<tt>damatra</tt>, <tt>p\u00e1tatra</tt> ''wing;'' but also <tt>\u00e1matra</tt> ''violent'', <tt>v\u00e1dhatra</tt> ''deadly weapon;'' and <tt>varatr\u0101\u0301</tt> f.

The words still used as adjectives in <tt>tra</tt> are mostly such as have union-vowels before the suffix. A single example from a reduplicated root is <tt>joh\u016b\u0301tra</tt> ''crying out''.\n\ng. A word or two in <tt>tri</tt> and <tt>tru</tt> may be added here, as perhaps of kindred formation with those in <tt>tra</tt>: thus, <tt>\u00e1ttri</tt> ''devouring'', <tt>arc\u00e1tri</tt> ''beaming'', <tt>r\u0101\u0301tri</tt> or <tt>r\u0101\u0301tr\u012b</tt> ''night;'' <tt>\u00e7\u00e1tru</tt> (<tt>\u00e7\u00e1ttru</tt>: 232) ''enemy''.\n\n1186. \u0915 <tt>ka</tt>.

But <tt>ka</tt> enters, in its value as secondary, into the composition of certain suffixes reckoned as primary: see <tt>aka</tt> and <tt>uka</tt> (above, 1180, 1181).\n\nc. A few words in which <tt>ika</tt> and <tt>\u012bka</tt> seem added to a root, though they are really of a kindred formation with the preceding, may be most conveniently noticed here: thus, <tt>v\u1e5b\u0301\u00e7cika</tt> (\u221a<tt>vra\u00e7c</tt>) ''scorpion;'' <tt>\u00e1n\u012bka</tt> (?)

Compare secondary suffix <tt>ka</tt> (below, 1222).\n\n1187. \u092f <tt>ya</tt>. It is altogether probable that a part of the derivatives made with this suffix are not less entitled to be ranked as primary than some of those which are above so reckoned. Such, however, are with so much doubt and difficulty to be separated from the great mass of secondary derivatives made with the same suffix that it is preferred to treat them all together under the head of secondary formation (below, 1210\u201313).\n\n1188. \u0930 <tt>ra</tt>. With this suffix are made a large number of adjectives, almost always with weak root-form, and usually with accent on the suffix. Also, a few words used as nouns, of various gender. In some cases, the suffix is found with a preceding vowel, having the aspect of a union-vowel.\n\na. Examples of adjectives in <tt>ra</tt> are: <tt>k\u1e63ipr\u00e1</tt> ''quick'', <tt>chidr\u00e1</tt> ''split'', <tt>tur\u00e1</tt> ''strong'', <tt>bhadr\u00e1</tt> ''pleasing'', <tt>\u00e7akr\u00e1</tt> ''mighty'', <tt>\u00e7ukr\u00e1</tt> ''bright'', <tt>hi\u1e45sr\u00e1</tt> ''injurious;'' with accent on the root, only <tt>g\u1e5b\u0301dhra</tt> ''greedy'', <tt>t\u00famra</tt> ''stout'', <tt>dh\u012b\u0301ra</tt> ''wise'' (secondary?), <tt>v\u00edpra</tt> ''inspired'', <tt>t\u00fagra</tt> n. pr.\n\nb. From roots with prefixes come only an example or two: thus, <tt>nicir\u00e1</tt> ''attentive'', <tt>n\u00edm\u1e5bgra</tt> ''joining on''.\n\nc. Nouns in <tt>ra</tt> are: masc., <tt>\u00e1jra</tt> ''field'', <tt>v\u012br\u00e1</tt> ''man'', <tt>v\u00e1jra</tt> ''thunderbolt'', <tt>\u00e7\u016b\u0301ra</tt> ''hero;'' neut., <tt>\u00e1gra</tt> ''point'', <tt>k\u1e63\u012br\u00e1</tt> ''milk'', <tt>r\u00e1ndhra</tt> ''hollow'', <tt>ripr\u00e1</tt> ''defilement;'' fem., <tt>dh\u0101\u0301r\u0101</tt> ''stream'', <tt>\u00e7\u00edpr\u0101</tt> ''jaw'', <tt>s\u00far\u0101</tt> ''intoxicating drink''.\n\nThe forms of this suffix with preceding vowel may best be considered here, although some of them have nearly or quite gained the value of independent endings. Thus:\n\nd.

Further, in exceptional cases, to indeclinables, to case-forms, and to phrases: e. g. <tt>antarvant, apitv\u00e1, paratastva, sahatva, s\u0101rvatrika, \u0101ikadhya, m\u0101\u0301maka, \u0101mu\u1e63mika, \u0101mu\u1e63y\u0101ya\u1e47\u00e1, apsum\u00e1nt, apsavy\u00e0, ki\u1e41canya, ki\u1e41kartavyat\u0101, kv\u0101citka, n\u0101stika, aki\u1e41cinmaya</tt>.\n\n1203. Changes of the stem. The stem to which the suffix is added is liable to certain changes of form.\n\na. Before a suffix beginning with a vowel or with <tt>y</tt> (which in this respect is treated as if it were <tt>i</tt>), final <tt>a</tt>- and <tt>i</tt>-vowels are regularly lost altogether, while a final <tt>u</tt>-vowel has the <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening and becomes <tt>av</tt>; <tt>\u1e5b</tt> and <tt>o</tt> and <tt>\u0101u</tt> (all of rare occurrence) are treated in accordance with usual euphonic rule.\n\nb. An <tt>u</tt>-vowel also sometimes remains unstrengthened: see 1208 e.\n\nc. A final <tt>n</tt> is variously treated, being sometimes retained, and sometimes lost, even along with a preceding <tt>a</tt>; and sometimes an <tt>a</tt> is lost, while the <tt>n</tt> remains: thus, <tt>v\u1e5b\u1e63a\u1e47vant, v\u1e5b\u1e63a\u1e47a, v\u1e5b\u1e63a, vr\u1e5b\u1e63atva, v\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ya</tt>, from <tt>v\u1e5b\u1e63an</tt>. Of a stem ending in <tt>ant</tt>, the weak form, in <tt>at</tt>, is regularly taken: thus, <tt>v\u0101ivasvata</tt> (<tt>vivasvant</tt>).\n\nd. In general, the masculine form of a primitive stem is that from which a further secondary derivative is made. But there are not very rare cases in which the feminine is taken instead; examples are <tt>sat\u012btva, bh\u0101ry\u0101tva, pran\u012bt\u0101tv\u00e1, bh\u0101rat\u012bvant, rak\u1e63\u0101vant, priy\u0101vant</tt>. On the other hand, a final long vowel \u2014 <tt>\u012b</tt>, much more rarely <tt>\u0101</tt> \u2014 generally of a feminine stem, is sometimes shortened in derivation: thus, <tt>y\u0101jy\u00e0vant, pra\u00e7\u0101khavant, go\u1e63\u00e1tama, va\u00e7\u00e1tam\u0101, sadhanitv\u00e1, jaratik\u0101, {{hws|ann\u0101|ann\u0101d\u00edtam\u0101}}</tt><noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"618045":{"pageid":618045,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/483","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><tt>{{hwe|d\u00edtam\u0101|ann\u0101d\u00edtam\u0101}}</tt> (cf. 471 b), <tt>rohinitv\u00e1</tt> (TB.; -<tt>n\u012btv\u00e1</tt> \u00c7B.), <tt>p\u1e5bhivitv\u00e1, pratipatnivat, s\u00e1rasvativant</tt>.\n\ne. As was pointed out above (111 c, d), the combination of a secondary suffix with a stem is sometimes made according to the rules of external combination. Such cases are pointed out under the suffixes <tt>\u012bya</tt> (1215 e), <tt>ka</tt> (1222 m), <tt>maya</tt> (1225 a), <tt>min</tt> (1231 b), <tt>vin</tt> (1232 c), <tt>vant</tt> (1233 i), <tt>van</tt> (1234 c), <tt>mant</tt> (1235 f), <tt>tva</tt> (1239 c), <tt>taya</tt> (1245 a), <tt>tya</tt> (1245 c), <tt>tana</tt> (1245 i).\n\n1204. The most frequent change in secondary derivation is the <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt>-strengthening of an initial syllable of the stem to which a suffix is added.\n\na. The strengthened syllable may be of any character: radical, of a prefix, or of the first member of a compound: thus, <tt>\u0101\u00e7vin\u00e1</tt> (<tt>a\u00e7v\u00edn</tt>), <tt>s\u0101umy\u00e1</tt> (<tt>s\u00f3ma</tt>), <tt>p\u0101\u0301rthiva</tt> (<tt>p\u1e5bthiv\u012b\u0301</tt>), <tt>\u0101mitr\u00e1</tt> (<tt>am\u00edtra</tt>), <tt>s\u0101\u0301mr\u0101jya</tt> (<tt>samr\u0101\u0301j</tt>), <tt>s\u0101\u00fak\u1e5btya</tt> (<tt>suk\u1e5bt\u00e1</tt>), <tt>m\u0101itr\u0101varu\u1e47\u00e1</tt> (<tt>mitr\u0101\u0301v\u00e1ru\u1e47\u0101</tt>), <tt>\u0101ucc\u0101i\u1e25\u00e7ravas\u00e1</tt> (<tt>ucc\u0101\u00ed\u1e25\u00e7ravas</tt>). As to the accompanying accent, see the next paragraph.\n\nb. If a stem begins with a consonant followed by <tt>y</tt> or <tt>v</tt>, the semivowel is sometimes vriddhied, as if it were <tt>i</tt> or <tt>u</tt>, and the resulting <tt>\u0101i</tt> or <tt>\u0101u</tt> has <tt>y</tt> or <tt>v</tt> further added before the succeeding vowel.\n\nc. This is most frequent where the <tt>y</tt> or <tt>v</tt> belongs to a prefix \u2014 as <tt>ni, vi, su</tt> \u2014 altered before a following initial vowel: thus, <tt>n\u0101iy\u0101yika</tt> from <tt>ny\u0101ya</tt> (as if <tt>niy\u0101ya</tt>), <tt>v\u0101iya\u00e7v\u00e1</tt> from <tt>vy\u00e0\u00e7va</tt> (as if <tt>viya\u00e7va</tt>), <tt>s\u0101\u00fava\u00e7vya</tt> from <tt>sv\u00e1\u00e7va</tt> (as if <tt>suva\u00e7va</tt>); but it occurs also in other cases, as <tt>s\u0101uvar\u00e1</tt> from <tt>sv\u00e1ra</tt>, <tt>\u00e7\u0101uva</tt> from <tt>\u00e7van</tt>, against <tt>sv\u0101yambhuva</tt> (<tt>svayambh\u016b</tt>), and so on. AV. has irregularly <tt>k\u0101verak\u00e1</tt> from <tt>k\u00favera</tt> (as if from <tt>kv\u00e9ra</tt>, without the euphonic <tt>y</tt> inserted).\n\nd. This strengthening takes place especially, and very often, before the suffixes <tt>a</tt> and <tt>ya</tt>; also regularly before <tt>i, \u0101yana, eya</tt> (with <tt>ineya</tt>), and later <tt>\u012bya</tt>; before the compound <tt>aka</tt> and <tt>ika</tt>, and later <tt>aki</tt>; and, in single sporadic examples before, <tt>na, ena, ra</tt>, and <tt>tva</tt> (?): see these various suffixes below.\n\ne. Sometimes an unstrengthened word is prefixed to one thus strengthened, as if the composition were made after instead of before the strengthening: e. g. <tt>indrad\u0101ivatya</tt> ''having Indra as divinity'' (instead of <tt>\u0101indradevatya</tt>), <tt>carama\u00e7\u0101ir\u1e63ika</tt> ''with head to the west'', <tt>j\u012bval\u0101ukika</tt> ''belonging to the world of the living'', <tt>antarbh\u0101uma</tt> ''within the earth'', <tt>som\u0101r\u0101udra, gurul\u0101ghava</tt> (cf. <tt>t\u0101masa\u1e41 gu\u1e47alak\u1e63a\u1e47am</tt> M. xii. 35). But especially when the first word is of numeral value: as <tt>\u00e7at\u00e1\u00e7\u0101rada</tt> ''of a hundred years'', <tt>pa\u00f1ca\u00e7\u0101rad\u012b\u0301ya, tris\u0101\u1e41vatsara, bahuv\u0101r\u1e63ika, a\u1e63\u1e6dav\u0101r\u1e63ika, anekavar\u1e63as\u0101hasra, da\u00e7as\u0101hasra, tris\u0101hasr\u012b, trip\u0101uru\u1e63a, catur\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b</tt> or -<tt>yik\u0101</tt> ''of four chapters'', etc. etc.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"618252":{"pageid":618252,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/484","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\nf. More often, both members of a compound word have the initial strengthening: e. g. <tt>s\u0101umap\u0101u\u1e63\u1e47\u00e1, k\u0101\u00farup\u0101\u00f1c\u0101la, c\u0101turv\u0101idya, \u0101ihal\u0101ukika, \u0101ikabh\u0101utika, tr\u0101is\u1e6dubj\u0101gata, y\u0101jurv\u0101idika</tt>. Such cases are not rare.\n\ng. The <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening (except of a final <tt>u</tt>-vowel: 1203 a) is only in the rarest cases an accompaniment of secondary derivation. Exceptions are <tt>dvay\u00e1</tt> and <tt>tray\u00e1</tt> and <tt>n\u00e1va</tt> (1200 i), <tt>bhe\u1e63aj\u00e1</tt> and <tt>dev\u00e1</tt> (1209 j), <tt>dr\u00f3na</tt> (1223 g), <tt>\u00e7ekhara</tt> (1226 a).\n\n1205. Accent. a. The derivatives with initial <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt>-strengthening always have their accent on either the first or the last syllable. And usually it is laid, as between these two situations, in such a way as to be furthest removed from the accent of the primitive; yet, not rarely, it is merely drawn down upon the suffix from the final of the latter; much less often, it remains upon an initial syllable without change. Only in the case of one or two suffixes is the distinction between initial and final accent connected with any difference in the meaning and use of the derivatives (see below, suffix <tt>eya</tt>: 1216).\n\nb. No other general rules as to accent can be given. Usually the suffix takes the tone, or else this remains where it was in the primitive; quite rarely, it is thrown back to the initial syllable (as in derivation with initial <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt>); and in a single case (<tt>t\u0101</tt>: 1237) it is drawn down to the syllable preceding the suffix.\n\n1206. Meaning. a. The great mass of secondary suffixes are adjective-making: they form from nouns adjectives indicating appurtenance or relation, of the most indefinite and varied character. But, as a matter of course, this indefiniteness often undergoes specialization: so, particularly, into designation of procedure or descent, so that distinctive patronymic and metronymic and gentile words are the result; or, again, into the designation of possession. Moreover, while the masculines and feminines of such adjectives are employed as appellatives, the neuter is also widely used as an abstract, denoting the quality expressed attributively by the adjective; and neuter abstracts are with the same suffixes made from adjectives. There are also special suffixes (very few) by which abstracts are made directly, from adjective or noun.\n\nb. A few suffixes make no change in the part of speech of the primitive, but either change its degree (diminution and comparison), or make other modifications, or leave its meaning not sensibly altered.\n\n1207. The suffixes will be taken up below in the following order. First, the general adjective-making suffixes, beginning with those of most frequent use (<tt>a, ya</tt> and its connections, <tt>i, ka</tt>); then, those of specific possessive value (<tt>in, vant</tt> and <tt>mant</tt>, and their connections); then, the abstract-making ones (<tt>t\u0101</tt> and <tt>tva</tt>, and their connections); then, the suffixes of comparison etc.; and finally, those by which derivatives are made only or almost only from particles.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"618676":{"pageid":618676,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/485","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\na.

With this suffix are made an immensely large class of derivatives, from nouns or from adjectives having a noun-value. Such derivatives are primarily and especially adjectives, denoting ''having a relation'' or ''connection'' (of the most various kind) ''with'' that denoted by the more primitive word. But they are also freely used substantively: the masculine and feminine as appellatives, the neuter, especially and frequently, as abstract. Often they have a patronymic or gentile value.\n\na. The regular and greatly prevailing formation is that which is accompanied with <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt>-strengthening of the first syllable of the primitive word, simple or compound.

The AV. has a somewhat smaller number (about twenty-five) of words of a like formation; but also a considerable group (fifteen) of derivatives in <tt>y\u00e0</tt> with the same value: thus, for example, <tt>\u0101dy\u00e0</tt> ''eatable'', <tt>k\u0101ry\u00e0</tt> ''to be done'', <tt>sam\u0101py\u00e0</tt> ''to be obtained'', <tt>atit\u0101ry\u00e0</tt> ''to be overpassed'', <tt>n\u012bvibh\u0101ry\u00e0</tt> ''to be carried in the apron'', <tt>prathamav\u0101sy\u00e0</tt> ''to be first worn'', These seem more markedly of secondary origin: and especially such forms as <tt>parivargy\u00e0</tt> ''to be avoided'', <tt>avimoky\u00e1</tt> ''not to be gotten rid of'', where the guttural reversion clearly indicates primitives in <tt>ga</tt> and <tt>ka</tt> (216 h).\n\nc. Throughout the older language are of common occurrence neuter abstract nouns of the same make with the former of these classes. They are rarely found except in composition (in AV., only <tt>c\u00edtya</tt> and <tt>st\u00e9ya</tt> as simple), and are often used in the dative, after the manner of a dative infinitive. Examples are: <tt>brahmajy\u00e9ya, vasud\u00e9ya, bh\u0101gadh\u00e9ya, p\u016brvap\u00e9ya, \u00e7atas\u00e9ya, abhibh\u016b\u0301ya, devah\u016b\u0301ya, mantra\u00e7r\u00fatya, karmak\u1e5b\u0301tya, v\u1e5btrat\u016b\u0301rya, hot\u1e5bv\u016b\u0301rya, ahih\u00e1tya, sattras\u00e1dya, \u00e7ir\u1e63abh\u00eddya, brahmac\u00e1rya, n\u1e5b\u1e63\u00e1hya</tt>.

This suffix also is apparently by origin a <tt>ya</tt> (<tt>\u012ba</tt>) of which the first element has maintained its long quantity by the interposition of a euphonic <tt>y</tt>. It is accented always on the <tt>\u012b\u0301</tt>.\n\na. In RV. occur, of general adjectives, only <tt>\u0101rjik\u012b\u0301ya</tt> and <tt>g\u1e5bhamedh\u012b\u0301ya</tt>, and examples in the later Vedic are very few: e. g. <tt>parvat\u012b\u0301ya</tt> ''mountainous'' (AV., beside RV. <tt>parvaty\u00e0</tt>). In the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as are found a number of adjectives, some of them from phrases (first words of verses and the like): thus, <tt>anyar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dr\u012b\u0301ya, pan\u0304cav\u0101t\u012b\u0301ya, m\u0101rj\u0101l\u012b\u0301ya, kay\u0101\u00e7ubh\u012bya, sv\u0101du\u1e63kil\u012bya, apohi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012bya</tt>, etc.\n\nb. It was pointed out above (965) that derivative adjectives in <tt>\u012bya</tt> from action-nouns in <tt>ana</tt> begin in later Veda and in Br\u0101hma\u1e47a to be used gerundivally, and are a recognized formation as gerundives in the classical language. But adjectives in <tt>an\u012blya</tt> without gerundive character are also common.\n\nc.

The possessives <tt>bhagavad\u012bya</tt> and <tt>bhavad\u012bya</tt>, with the final of the primitive made sonant, have probably had their form determined by the pronominal possessives in -<tt>d\u012bya</tt>.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"622791":{"pageid":622791,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/493","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\n1216. \u090f\u092f <tt>eya</tt>. With this suffix, accompanied by <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt>-increment of an initial syllable, are made adjectives, often having a patronymic or metronymic value. Their neuter is sometimes used as abstract noun. The accent rests usually on the final in adjectives of descent, and on the first syllable in others.\n\na. Examples are: <tt>\u0101r\u1e63ey\u00e1</tt> ''descendant of a sage'' (<tt>\u1e5b\u0301\u1e63i</tt>), <tt>j\u0101na\u00e7rutey\u00e1</tt> ''son of J\u0101nacruti'', <tt>s\u0101ramey\u00e1</tt> ''of Sar\u00e1m\u0101's race'', <tt>\u00e7\u0101tavaney\u00e1</tt> ''\u00c7atavani's descendant'', <tt>r\u0101thajitey\u00e1</tt> ''son of Rathaj\u00edt;'' <tt>\u0101\u0301sneya</tt> ''of the blood'' (<tt>as\u00e1n</tt>), <tt>v\u0101\u0301steya</tt> ''of the bladder'' (<tt>vast\u00ed</tt>), <tt>p\u0101\u00faru\u1e63eya</tt> ''coming from man'' (<tt>p\u00faru\u1e63a</tt>), <tt>p\u0101it\u1e5bsvaseya</tt> ''of a paternal aunt'' (<tt>pit\u1e5bsvas\u1e5b</tt>), etc.\n\nb. A more than usual proportion of derivatives in <tt>eya</tt> come from primitives in <tt>i</tt> or <tt>\u012b</tt>; and probably the suffix first gained its form by addition of <tt>ya</tt> to a gunated <tt>i</tt>, though afterward used independently.\n\nc. The gerundive etc. derivatives in <tt>ya</tt> (above, 1213) from <tt>\u0101</tt>-roots end in <tt>\u00e9ya</tt>; and, besides such, RV. etc. have <tt>sabh\u00e9ya</tt> from <tt>sabh\u0101\u0301</tt>, and <tt>did\u1e5bk\u1e63\u00e9ya</tt> ''worth seeing'', apparently from the desiderative noun <tt>did\u1e5bk\u1e63\u0101\u0301</tt>, after their analogy. M. has once <tt>adhyeya</tt> as gerund of \u221a<tt>i</tt>.\n\nd.

In <tt>eyya</tt> (i. e. <tt>eyia</tt>) end, besides the neuter abstract <tt>saha\u00e7\u00e9yya</tt> (above, 1213 c), the adjective of gerundival meaning <tt>stu\u1e63\u00e9yya</tt> (with aoristic <tt>s</tt> added to the root), and <tt>\u00e7apatheyy\u00e0</tt> ''curse-bringing'' (or ''accursed''), from <tt>\u00e7ap\u00e1tha</tt>.\n\n1217. \u090f\u0928\u094d\u092f <tt>enya</tt>. This suffix is doubtless secondary in origin, made by the addition of \u092f <tt>ya</tt> to derivatives in a <tt>na</tt>-suffix; but, like others of similar origin, it is applied in some measure independently, chiefly in the older language, where it has nearly the value of the later <tt>an\u012bya</tt> (above, 1215 b), as making gerundival adjectives.\n\na.

With this suffix are made gerundival adjectives, almost only in RV. They have been noticed above (966 c). The ending is everywhere to be read as <tt>\u0101\u0301yia</tt>.\n\na. A few adjectives without gerundival value, and neuter abstracts, also occur: thus, <tt>bahup\u0101\u0301yya</tt> ''protecting many'', <tt>n\u1e5bp\u0101\u0301yya</tt> ''men-guarding;'' <tt>ku\u1e47\u1e0dap\u0101\u0301yya</tt>, and <tt>purum\u0101\u0301yya</tt>, proper names; <tt>p\u016brvap\u0101\u0301yya</tt> ''first drink'', <tt>mahay\u0101\u0301yya</tt> ''enjoyment;'' \u2014 and <tt>ras\u0101\u0301yya</tt> ''nervous'', and <tt>uttam\u0101\u0301yya</tt> ''summit'', contain no verbal root. <tt>Al\u0101\u0301yya</tt> is doubtful; also <tt>\u0101k\u0101yy\u00e0</tt>, which its accent refers to a different formation, along with <tt>prah\u0101yy\u00e0</tt> (AV.: \u221a<tt>hi</tt>) ''messenger'', and <tt>prav\u0101yy\u00e0</tt> (AV.), of doubtful value.\n\n1219. \u0906\u092f\u0928 <tt>\u0101yana</tt>. In the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as and later, patronymics made by this suffix are not rare. They come from stems in, \u0905 <tt>a</tt>, and have <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt>-strengthening of the first syllable, and accent on the final.\n\na. In RV., the only example of this formation is <tt>k\u0101\u1e47v\u0101yana</tt> (voc.: <tt>k\u00e1\u1e47va</tt>); AV. has in metrical parts <tt>d\u0101k\u1e63\u0101ya\u1e47\u00e1</tt> and the fem. <tt>r\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47\u012b\u0301</tt>; and <tt>\u0101mu\u1e63y\u0101ya\u1e47\u00e1</tt> ''son of so-and-so'' (516) in its prose; \u00c7B. has <tt>r\u0101jastamb\u0101\u0301yana</tt> beside -<tt>b\u0101yan\u00e1</tt>. The RV. name <tt>uk\u1e63a\u1e47y\u0101\u0301yana</tt> is of a different make, elsewhere unknown.\n\n1220. \u0906\u092f\u0940 <tt>\u0101y\u012b</tt>. Only a very few words are made with this suffix, namely <tt>agn\u0101\u0301y\u012b</tt> (<tt>agn\u00ed</tt>) ''Agni's wife'', <tt>v\u1e5b\u1e63\u0101kap\u0101y\u012b</tt> ''wife of Vrish\u0101\u0301kapi;'' and later <tt>p\u016btakr\u0101tay\u012b</tt>, and <tt>man\u0101y\u012b</tt> ''Manu's wife'' (but <tt>man\u0101v\u012b\u0301</tt> \u00c7B.).\n\na. They seem to be feminines of a derivative in <tt>a</tt> made with <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt>-increment of the final <tt>i</tt> of the primitive.\n\n1221. \u0907 <tt>i</tt>. Derivatives made with this suffix are patronymics from nouns in <tt>a</tt>. The accent rests on the initial syllable, which has the <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt>-strengthening.\n\na. In RV. are found half-a-dozen patronymics in <tt>i</tt>: for example, <tt>\u0101\u0301gnive\u00e7i, p\u0101\u00farukutsi, pr\u0101\u0301tardani, s\u0101\u0301\u1e41vara\u1e47i</tt>; AV. has but one, <tt>pr\u0101\u0301hr\u0101di</tt>; in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as they are more common: thus, in AB., <tt>s\u0101uyavasi, j\u0101na\u1e41tapi, \u0101ru\u1e47i, j\u0101naki</tt>, etc. A single word of other value \u2014 <tt>s\u0101\u0301rathi</tt> ''charioteer'' (<tt>sar\u00e1tham</tt>) \u2014 is found from RV. down.\n\nb.

That the secondary suffix <tt>ika</tt> is probably made by addition of <tt>ka</tt> to a derivative in <tt>i</tt> is pointed out below (1222 j).\n\nc.

Such derivatives in the later language are innumerable; from almost any given noun or adjective may be made an equivalent, ending in <tt>ka</tt> or <tt>k\u0101</tt> (according to the gender).\n\ng.

In the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as and later, <tt>ka</tt> is often added to a possessive adjective compound (1307), sometimes redundantly, but usually in order to obtain a more manageable stem for inflection: thus, <tt>anak\u1e63\u00edka</tt> ''eyeless'', <tt>atvakk\u00e1</tt> ''skinless'', <tt>aret\u00e1ska</tt> ''without seed'', <tt>vyasthaka</tt> ''boneless'', <tt>sa\u00e7iraska</tt> ''along with the head'', <tt>ekag\u0101yatr\u012bka</tt> ''containing a single'' <tt>g\u0101yatr\u012b</tt>''-verse'', <tt>g\u1e5bh\u012bt\u00e1vasat\u012bvar\u012bka</tt> ''one who has taken yesterday's water'', <tt>sapatn\u012bka</tt> ''with his spouse'', <tt>bahuhast\u00edka</tt> ''having many elephants'', <tt>sad\u012bk\u1e63opas\u00e1tka</tt> ''with'' <tt>d\u012bk\u1e63\u0101</tt> ''and'' <tt>upasad</tt>, <tt>\u0101hitasamitka</tt> ''with his fuel laid on'', <tt>abhinavavayaska</tt> ''of youthful age'', <tt>an\u0304gu\u1e63\u1e6dham\u0101traka</tt> ''of thumb size''.\n\ni. The vowel by which the <tt>ka</tt> is preceded has often an irregular character; and especially, a feminine in <tt>ik\u0101</tt> is so common beside a masculine in <tt>aka</tt> as to be its regular correspondent (as is the case with the so-called primary <tt>aka</tt>: above, 1181). In RV. are found beside one another only <tt>iyattak\u00e1</tt> and <tt>iyattik\u0101\u0301</tt>; but AV. has several examples.\n\nj. Two suffixes made up of <tt>ka</tt> and a preceding vowel \u2014 namely, <tt>aka</tt> and <tt>ika</tt> \u2014 are given by the grammarians as independent secondary suffixes, requiring initial <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt>-strengthening of the primitive. Both of them are doubtless originally made by addition of <tt>ka</tt> to a final <tt>i</tt> or <tt>a</tt>, though coming to be used independently.\n\nk. Of <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt>-derivatives in aka no examples have been noted from the older language (unless <tt>m\u0101mak\u00e1</tt> ''mine'' is to be so regarded); and they are not common in the later: thus, <tt>\u0101va\u00e7yaka</tt> ''necessary'', <tt>v\u0101rddhaka</tt> ''old age'', <tt>r\u0101ma\u1e47\u012byaka</tt> ''delightfulness''.\n\nl. Of <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt>-derivatives in <tt>ika</tt>, the Veda furnishes a very few cases: <tt>v\u0101\u0301santika</tt> ''vernal'', <tt>v\u0101\u0301r\u1e63ika</tt> ''of the rainy season'', <tt>h\u0101\u00edmantika</tt> ''wintry'' (none of them in RV.); AV. has <tt>k\u0101ir\u0101tik\u0101\u0301</tt> ''of the Kir\u0101tas'', apparent fem. to a masc. <tt>k\u0101ir\u0101taka</tt>, which is not found till later. Examples from a more recent period (when they become abundant) are: <tt>v\u0101idika</tt> ''relating to the Vedas'', <tt>dh\u0101rmika</tt> ''religious'', <tt>\u0101hnika</tt> ''daily'', <tt>v\u0101inayika</tt> ''well-behaved'', <tt>d\u0101uv\u0101rika</tt> ''doorkeeper'', <tt>n\u0101iy\u0101yika</tt> ''versed in the Ny\u0101ya''.\n\nm. Before the suffix <tt>ka</tt>, some finals show a form which is characteristic of external rather than internal combination. A final sonant mute, of course, becomes surd, and an aspirate loses its aspiration (117 a, 114): cf. -<tt>upasatka</tt>, -<tt>samitka</tt>, above, h. So also a palatal becomes guttural (as before <tt>t</tt> etc.: 217): e. g. -<tt>srukka</tt>, -<tt>rukka</tt>, -<tt>tvakka</tt>, <tt>an\u1e5bkka</tt>. A <tt>s</tt> remains after <tt>\u0101\u02d8</tt>, and becomes <tt>\u1e63</tt> after an alterant vowel (180): e. g. <tt>sadyaska, jyoti\u1e63ka, dirgh\u0101yu\u1e63ka</tt>.

The feminines in <tt>n\u012b</tt> and <tt>kn\u012b</tt> from masculine stems in <tt>ta</tt> have been already noticed above (1176 d). From <tt>p\u00e1ti</tt> ''master, husband'' the feminine is <tt>p\u00e1tn\u012b</tt>, both as independent word, ''spouse'', and as final of an adjective compound: thus, <tt>dev\u00e1patn\u012b</tt> ''having a god for husband'', <tt>s\u00edndhupatn\u012b</tt> ''having the Indus as master''. And the feminine of <tt>paru\u1e63\u00e1</tt> ''rough'' is in the older language sometimes <tt>p\u00e1ru\u1e63\u1e47\u012b</tt>.\n\nd. With <tt>\u012bna</tt> are made a full series of adjective derivatives from the words with final <tt>a\u00f1c</tt> (407 ff.); they are accented usually upon the penult, but sometimes on the final; and the same word has sometimes both accents: for example, <tt>ap\u0101c\u012b\u0301na, n\u012bc\u012b\u0301na, pr\u0101c\u012b\u0301na, arv\u0101c\u012b\u0301na</tt> and <tt>arv\u0101c\u012bn\u00e1, prat\u012bc\u012b\u0301na</tt> and <tt>prat\u012bc\u012bn\u00e1, sam\u012bc\u012bn\u00e1</tt>. Besides these, a number of other adjectives, earlier and later: examples are <tt>sa\u1e41vatsar\u012b\u0301na</tt> ''yearly'', <tt>pr\u0101v\u1e5b\u1e63\u012b\u0301\u1e47a</tt> ''of the rainy season'', <tt>vi\u00e7vajan\u012b\u0301na</tt> ''of all people'', <tt>j\u00f1\u0101takul\u012b\u0301na</tt> ''of known family'', <tt>adhvan\u012bna</tt> ''traveller'' (<tt>\u00e1dhvan</tt> ''way''), <tt>\u0101\u00e7v\u012bna</tt> ''day's journey on horseback'' (<tt>\u00e1\u00e7va</tt> ''horse''). RV. has once <tt>m\u0101\u0301k\u012bna</tt> ''mine''.\n\ne.

In the oldest language (V.), final <tt>as</tt> remains unchanged before the suffix: thus, <tt>manasm\u00e1ya, nabhasm\u00e1ya, ayasm\u00e1ya</tt>; but <tt>d</tt> is treated as in external combination: thus, <tt>m\u1e5bnm\u00e1ya</tt>; and in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as and later, finals in general have the latter treatment: e. g. <tt>tejom\u00e1ya, adom\u00e1ya, \u0101pom\u00e1ya, jyotirmaya, yajurm\u00e1ya, etanm\u00e1ya, as\u1e5dn\u0304maya, v\u0101n\u0304m\u00e1ya, ammaya, pr\u0101v\u1e5b\u1e47maya</tt>. RV. has <tt>a\u00e7manm\u00e1ya</tt> (later <tt>a\u00e7mamaya</tt>). In <tt>hira\u1e47m\u00e1ya</tt> (B. and later) the primitive (<tt>hira\u1e47ya</tt>) is peculiarly mutilated. RV. has <tt>s\u016bm\u00e1ya</tt> ''of good make'', and <tt>kimm\u00e1ya</tt> ''made of what?''\n\nb. A very few examples of a feminine in <tt>y\u0101</tt> occur in the later language.\n\n1226. \u0930 <tt>ra</tt>. A few derivative adjectives are made with this suffix. Accent and treatment of the primitive are various.\n\na.

The use of <tt>ra</tt> in forming a few words of comparative meaning was noticed above (474), and the words so made were given.\n\n1227. \u0932 <tt>la</tt>. This and the preceding suffix are really but two forms of the same. In some words they exchange with one another, and \u0932 <tt>la</tt> is usually, but not always, the later form in use.\n\na. Examples are: <tt>bahul\u00e1</tt> ''abundant'', <tt>madhul\u00e1</tt> (later <tt>madhura</tt>) and <tt>madh\u016bla</tt> ''sweet'', <tt>bh\u012bmala</tt> ''fearful'', <tt>j\u012bval\u00e1</tt> ''lively'', <tt>a\u00e7l\u012bl\u00e1</tt> (and <tt>a\u00e7r\u012br\u00e1</tt>) ''wretched;'' with <tt>\u0101</tt>, <tt>v\u0101c\u0101la</tt> ''talkative'' (late); with <tt>i</tt>, <tt>phenila</tt> ''foamy'' (late:<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"624730":{"pageid":624730,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/499","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><tt>ph\u00e9na</tt>); with <tt>u</tt>, <tt>v\u0101tula</tt> and <tt>v\u0101t\u016bla</tt> ''windy'' (late: <tt>v\u0101\u0301ta</tt>); and <tt>m\u0101tula</tt> ''maternal uncle'' is a somewhat irregular formation from <tt>m\u0101t\u1e5b\u0301</tt> ''mother''.\n\nb. In the later language are found a few adjectives in <tt>lu</tt>, always preceded by <tt>\u0101</tt>; examples are: <tt>k\u1e5bp\u0101lu</tt> and <tt>day\u0101lu</tt> ''compassionate'', <tt>\u012br\u1e63y\u0101lu</tt> ''jealous'', <tt>u\u1e63\u1e47\u0101lu</tt> ''heated'', <tt>\u00e7ay\u0101lu</tt> and <tt>svapn\u0101lu</tt> ''sleepy'', <tt>lajj\u0101lu</tt> ''modest'', <tt>l\u0101l\u0101lu</tt> ''drooling'', <tt>\u00e7raddh\u0101lu</tt> ''trusting'', <tt>krodh\u0101lu</tt> ''passionate''. One or two such derivatives having a primary aspect were noticed at 1192 b.\n\n1228. \u0935 <tt>va</tt>. A small number of adjectives have this ending (accented, added to an unaltered primitive).\n\na. Examples are: <tt>ar\u1e47av\u00e1</tt> ''billowy'', <tt>ke\u00e7av\u00e1</tt> ''hairy;'' <tt>r\u0101sn\u0101v\u00e1</tt> ''girded;'' <tt>a\u00f1jiv\u00e1</tt> ''slippery'', <tt>\u00e7antiv\u00e1</tt> ''tranquillizing'', <tt>\u00e7raddhiv\u00e1</tt> ''credible'', <tt>ama\u1e47iva</tt> ''jewelless'', <tt>r\u0101j\u012bva</tt> ''striped''.\n\nb. There are a very few adjectives in <tt>vala</tt> and <tt>vaya</tt> which may be noticed here: thus, <tt>k\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bval\u00e1</tt> ''peasant'' (<tt>k\u1e5b\u1e63i</tt> ''ploughing''), <tt>\u016br\u1e47\u0101val\u00e1</tt> ''wooly'', <tt>rajasvala, \u016brjasvala, payasvala, \u00e7\u0101dvala, na\u1e0dvala, \u00e7ikh\u0101vala, dant\u0101vala</tt>; <tt>druv\u00e1ya</tt> ''wooden dish'', <tt>caturvaya</tt> ''fourfold''.\n\nc. With <tt>vya</tt> are made two or three words from names of relationship: thus, <tt>p\u00edt\u1e5bvya</tt> ''paternal uncle'', <tt>bhr\u0101\u0301t\u1e5bvya</tt> ''nephew, enemy''.\n\n1229. \u0936 <tt>\u00e7a</tt>. A very few adjectives appear to be made by an added ending of this form.\n\na. Thus, <tt>roma\u00e7\u00e1</tt> or <tt>loma\u00e7\u00e1</tt> ''hairy'', <tt>\u00e9ta\u00e7a</tt> (also <tt>eta\u00e7\u00e1</tt>) ''variegated'', <tt>arva\u00e7\u00e1</tt> or <tt>\u00e1rva\u00e7a</tt> ''hasting'', <tt>babhlu\u00e7\u00e1</tt> or <tt>babhru\u00e7\u00e1</tt> and <tt>kapi\u00e7a</tt> ''brownish'', <tt>k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u00e7a</tt> ''blackish'', <tt>yuva\u00e7\u00e1</tt> ''youthful'', <tt>b\u0101li\u00e7a</tt> ''childish'', <tt>karka\u00e7a</tt> ''harsh'', <tt>karma\u00e7a</tt> (?) n. pr.; and <tt>giri\u00e7a, v\u0101ri\u00e7a</tt> (?), <tt>v\u1e5bk\u1e63a\u00e7a</tt> are doubtless of the same character (not containing the root <tt>\u00e7\u012b</tt>). The character of <tt>har\u012bma\u00e7\u00e1, k\u00e1\u00e7ma\u00e7a, kal\u00e1\u00e7a</tt> is doubtful.\n\nb. Many of the adjective derivatives already treated have sometimes a possessive value, the general meaning of ''being concerned with, having relation to'' being specialized into that of ''being in possession of''. But there are also a few distinctively possessive suffixes; and some of these, on account of the unlimited freedom of using them and the frequency of their occurrence, are very conspicuous parts of the general system of derivation. These will be next considered.\n\n1230. \u0907\u0928\u094d <tt>in</tt>. Possessive adjectives of this ending may be formed almost unlimitedly from stems in \u0905 <tt>a</tt> or \u0906 <tt>\u0101</tt>, and are sometimes (but very rarely) made from stems with other finals.\n\na. A final vowel disappears before the suffix. The accent is on the suffix. As to the inflection of these adjectives, see above, 438 ff.

Derivatives from other stems are very few in comparison: thus, from <tt>i</tt>-stems, <tt>atithin</tt> (?), <tt>abhim\u0101t\u00edn, arc\u00edn, a\u00e7anin, \u016brmin, k\u0101lanemin, kh\u0101d\u00edn, -p\u0101\u1e47in, mar\u012bcin, mau\u00f1jin, m\u0101ulin, -yonin, venin, sa\u1e41dhin, sam\u1e5bddhin, surabhin</tt> (of those found only at the end of a possessive compound the character is doubtful, since case-forms of <tt>i</tt>- and <tt>in</tt>-stems are not seldom exchanged); from <tt>u</tt>-stems, <tt>gurvin, \u00e7atagv\u00edn</tt> (?), <tt>ve\u1e47avin</tt> (with <tt>guna</tt> of the <tt>u</tt>); \u2014 from stems in <tt>an</tt>, <tt>varm\u00edn,  karmin, carmin, -chadmin, janmin, dhanvin, -dharmin, n\u0101min, brahmin, yak\u1e63min, \u00e7armin</tt>, and <tt>\u00e7vanin</tt>; \u2014 in <tt>as</tt>, <tt>ret\u00edn</tt> ''rich in seed'', and probably <tt>varcin</tt> n. pr.; also (perhaps through stems in -<tt>sa</tt>) <tt>\u00e7avas\u00edn</tt> and <tt>sahasin, manas\u00edn, -vayas\u00edn</tt>; \u2014 isolated are <tt>parisraj\u00edn</tt> ''garlanded'', and <tt>hiran\u00edn</tt> (<tt>hir\u00e1nya</tt>).\n\nd. It was pointed out above (1183) that derivatives in <tt>in</tt> have assumed on a large scale the aspect and value of primary derivatives, with the significance of present participles, especially at the end of compounds. The properly secondary character of the whole formation is shown, on the one hand, by the frequent use in the same manner of words bearing an unmistakably secondary form, as <tt>pra\u00e7n\u00edn, garbh\u00edn, j\u016br\u1e47\u00edn, dh\u016bm\u00edn, sn\u0101nin, homin, matsar\u00edn, paripanth\u00edn, pravepan\u00edn, sa\u1e41gatin</tt>; and, on the other hand, by the occurrence of reverted palatals (216) before the <tt>in</tt>, which could only be as <tt>in</tt> replaced <tt>a</tt>: thus, <tt>ark\u00edn, -bhan\u0304g\u00edn, -san\u0304g\u00edn, -rok\u00edn</tt>.\n\ne. In a few cases, there appears before the <tt>in</tt> a <tt>y</tt> preceded by an <tt>\u0101</tt> of inorganic character: thus, <tt>dhanv\u0101y\u00edn, tantr\u0101y\u00edn, \u00e7vet\u0101y\u00edn, s\u1e5bk\u0101y\u00edn, \u0101tat\u0101y\u00edn, pratihit\u0101y\u00edn, mar\u0101y\u00edn, \u1e5bt\u0101y\u00edn, svadh\u0101y\u00edn</tt> (VS.: TB. -<tt>v\u00edn</tt>). The <tt>y</tt> in all such words is evidently the inserted <tt>y</tt> after <tt>\u0101</tt> (258 a), and to assume for them a suffix <tt>yin</tt> is quite needless.\n\nf. The accentuation <tt>pravr\u0101\u0301jin, prasy\u00e1ndin</tt>, in the concluding part of \u00c7B., is doubtless false; and the same is to be suspected for <tt>\u00e7\u0101\u0301k\u012b, s\u00e1r\u012b, \u00edr\u012b</tt> (RV., each once).\n\ng. A very few words in <tt>in</tt> have not suffered the possessive specialization. Such are <tt>van\u00edn</tt> ''tree, hermit'', <tt>kapot\u00edn</tt> ''dovelike'', <tt>a\u1e47\u1e0din</tt> ''scrotum-like'' (cf. 1233 f).\n\n1231. \u092e\u093f\u0928\u094d <tt>min</tt>. With this suffix are made an extremely small number of possessive adjectives.\n\na.
