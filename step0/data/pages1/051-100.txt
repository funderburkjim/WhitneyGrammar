This view is supported by the derivation of h from the aspirates (next paragraph), by that of \u1e37 + h from \u1e0dh (54), and by the treatment of initial h after a final mute (163).\n\n66. The h, as already noticed, is not an original sound, but comes in nearly all cases from an older gh (for the few instances of its derivation from dh and bh, see below, 223 g). It is a vastly more frequent sound than the unchanged gh (namely, as 7 to 1): more frequent, indeed, than any of the guttural mutes except k. It appears, like j (219), to include in itself two stages of corruption of gh: one corresponding with that of k to c, the other with that of k to \u00e7; see below, 223, for the roots belonging to the two classes respectively. Like the other sounds of guttural derivation, it sometimes exhibits \u201creversion\u201d (43) to its original.\n\n67. The \u0903 \u1e25, or visarga (visarjan\u012bya, as it is uniformly called by the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas and by P\u0101\u1e47ini, probably as ''belonging to the end of a syllable''), appears to be merely a surd breathing, a final ''h''-sound (in the European sense of ''h''), uttered in the articulating position of the preceding vowel.\n\na. One Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khya (TPr. ii. 48) gives just this last description of it. It is by various authorities classed with h, or with h and a: all of them are alike sounds in whose utterance the mouth-organs have no definite shaping action.\n\n68. The visarga is not original, but always only a substitute for final s or r, neither of which is allowed to maintain itself unchanged (170 ff.). It is a comparatively recent member of the alphabetic system; the other euphonic changes of final s and r have not passed through visarga as an intermediate stage. And the Hindu authorities are considerably discordant with one another as to how far \u1e25 is a necessary substitute, and how far a permitted one, alternative with a sibilant, before a following initial surd.\n\n69. Before a surd guttural or labial,respectively, some of the native authorities permit, while others require, conversion of final s or r into the so-called jihv\u0101m\u016bl\u012bya and upadhm\u0101n\u012bya spirants. It may be fairly questioned, perhaps, whether these two sounds are not pure grammatical abstractions, devised (like the long \u1e37-vowel: 23 a) in order to round out the alphabet to greater symmetry. At any rate, both manuscripts and printed texts in general make no account of them. Whatever individual character they may have must be, it would seem, in the direction of the (German) ''ch''- and ''f''-sounds. When written at all, they are wont to be transliterated by ''\u03c7'' and ''\u03c6''.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235321":{"pageid":235321,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/52","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>70. The \u0902 anusv\u0101ra, \u1e45 or \u1e41, is a nasal sound lacking that closure of the organs which is required to make a nasal mute or contact-sound (36); in its utterance there is nasal resonance along with some degree of openness of the mouth.</p>\n\n71. There is discordance of opinion among both the Hindu phonetists and their modern European successors respecting the real character of this element; hence a little detail is necessary here with regard to its occurrence and their views of it.\n\na. Certain nasals in Sanskrit are of servile character, always to be assimilated to a following consonant, of whatever character that may be. Such are final m in sentence-combination (213), the penultimate nasal of a root, and a nasal of increment (255) in general. If one of these nasals stands before a contact-letter or mute, it becomes a nasal mute corresponding the the latter \u2014 that is, a nasal utterance in the same position of the mouth-organs which gives the succeeding mute. If, on the other hand, the following consonant does not involve a contact (being a semivowel or spirant), the nasal element is also without contact: it is a nasal utterance with unclosed mouth-organs. The question is, now, whether this nasal utterance becomes merely a nasal infection of the preceding vowel, turning it into a nasal vowel (as in French ''on, en, un'', etc., by reason of a similar loss of a nasal mute); or whether it is an element of more individual character, having place between the vowel and the consonant; or, once more, whether it is sometimes the one thing and sometimes the other. The opinions of the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas and P\u0101\u1e47ini are briefly as follows:\n\nb. The Atharva-Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khya holds that the result is everywhere a nasalized vowel, except when n or m is assimilated to a following l; in that case, the n or m becomes a nasal l: that is, the nasal utterance is made in the l-position, and has a perceptible l-character.\n\nc. The other Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas teach a similar conversion into a nasal counterpart to the semivowel, or a nasal semivowel, before y and l and v (not before r also). In most of the other cases where the Atharva-Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khya acknowledges a nasal vowel \u2014 namely, before r and the spirants \u2014 the others teach the intervention after the vowel of a distinct nasal element, called the anusv\u0101ra ''after-tone''.\n\nd. Of the nature of this nasal afterpiece to the vowel no intelligibly clear account is given. It is said (RPr.) to be either vowel or consonant; it is declared (RPr., VPr.) to be made with the nose alone, or (TPr.) to be nasal like the nasal mutes; it is held by some (RPr.) to be the sonant tone of the nasal mutes; in its formation, as in that of the vowel and spirant, there is (RPr.) no contact. As to its quantity, see further on.\n\ne. There are, however, certain cases and classes of cases where these other authorities also acknowledge a nasal vowel.

They also mention the doctrine of nasal vowel instead of anusv\u0101ra as held by some (and TPr. is uncertain and inconsistent in its choice between the one and the other).\n\nf. In P\u0101\u1e47ini, finally, the prevailing doctrine is that of anusv\u0101ra everywhere, and it is even allowed in many cases where the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas prescribe only a nasal mute. But a nasal semivowel is also allowed instead before a semivowel, and a nasal vowel is allowed in the cases (mentioned above) where some of the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas require it by exception.\n\ng. It is evidently a fair question whether this discordance and uncertainty of the Hindu phonetists is owing to a real difference of utterance in different classes of cases and in different localities, or whether to a different scholastic analysis of what is really everywhere the same utterance. If anusv\u0101ra is a nasal element following the vowel, it cannot well be any thing but either a prolongation of the same vowel-sound with nasality added, or a nasalized bit of neutral-vowel sound (in the latter case, however, the altering influence of an i or u-vowel on a following s ought to be prevented, which is not the case: see 183).\n\n72. The assimilated nasal element, whether viewed as nasalized vowel, nasal semivowel, or independent anusv\u0101ra, has the value of something added, in making a heavy syllable, or length by position (79).\n\na. The Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas (VPr., RPr.) give determinations of the quantity of the anusv\u0101ra combining with a short and with a long vowel respectively to make a long syllable.\n\n73. a. Two different signs, \u0902 and \u0901, are found in the manuscripts, indicating the nasal sound here treated of. Usually they are written above the syllable, and there they seem most naturally to imply a nasal affection of the vowel of the syllable, a nasal (anun\u0101sika) vowel. Hence some texts (S\u0101ma- and Yajur-Vedas), when they mean a real anusv\u0101ra, bring one of the signs down into the ordinary consonant-place; but the usage is not general. As between the two signs, some manuscripts employ, or tend to employ, the \u0901 where a nasalized (anun\u0101sika) vowel is to be recognized, and elsewhere the \u0902; and this distinction is consistently observed in many European printed texts; and the former is called the anun\u0101sika sign: but the two are doubtless originally and properly equivalent.\n\nb. It is a very common custom of the manuscripts to write an anusv\u0101ra-sign for any nasal following the vowel of a syllable, either before another consonant or as final (not before a vowel), without any reference to whether it is to be pronounced as nasal mute, nasal semivowel, or anusv\u0101ra. Some printed texts follow this slovenly and undesirable habit; but most write a nasal mute whenever it is to be pronounced \u2014 excepting where it is an assimilated m (213).<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235323":{"pageid":235323,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/54","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>c.

This is the whole system of sounds recognized by the written character; for certain other transitional sounds, more or less widely recognized in the theories of the Hindu phonetists, see below, 230.\n\n75.

Quantity of sounds and syllables.</center>\n\n76. The Hindu grammarians take the pains to define the quantity of a consonant (without distinction among consonants of different classes) as half that of a short vowel.\n\n77. They also define the quantity of a long (d\u012brgha) vowel or diphthong as twice that of a short (hrasva) vowel \u2014 making no distinction in this respect between the gu\u1e47a- and the v\u1e5bddhi-diphthongs.\n\n78. Besides these two vowel-quantities, the Hindus acknowledge a third, called ''pluta'' (literally swimming), or protracted, and having three ''moras'' or three times the quantity of a short vowel. A protracted vowel is marked by a following figure 3: thus, \u0906\u0969 \u01013.\n\na. The protracted vowels are practically of rare occurrence (in RV., three cases; in AV., fifteen; in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a literature, decidedly more frequent). They are used in cases of questioning, especially of a balancing between two alternatives, and also of calling to a distance or urgently. The protraction is of the last syllable in a word, or in a whole phrase; and the protracted syllable has usually the acute tone, in addition to any other accent the word may have; sometimes it takes also anusv\u0101ra, or is made nasal.\n\nb. Examples are: adh\u00e1\u1e25 svid \u0101s\u012b\u03013d up\u00e1ri svid \u0101s\u012b3t (RV.)

A diphthong is protracted by prolongation of its first or a-element: thus, e to \u01013i, o to \u01013u.\n\nd. The sign of protraction is also sometimes written as the result of accentual combination, when so-called kampa occurs: see below, 87 d.\n\n79. For metrical purposes, syllables (not vowels) are distinguished by the grammarians as heavy (guru) or light (laghu). A syllable is heavy if its vowel is long, or short and followed by more than one consonant (\u201clong by position\u201d).

The last syllable of a p\u0101da (primary division of a verse) is reckoned as either heavy or light.\n\na. The distinction in terms between the difference of long and short in vowel-sound and that of heavy and light in syllable-construction is valuable and should be observed.\n\n<center>IV. Accent.</center>\n\n80. The phenomena of accent are, by the Hindu grammarians of all ages alike, described and treated as depending on a variation of tone or pitch; of any difference of stress involved, they make no account.\n\n81. The primary tones (svara) or accent-pitches are two: a higher (ud\u0101tta ''raised''), or acute; and a lower (anud\u0101tta ''not raised''), or grave. A third (called svarita: a term of doubtful meaning) is always of secondary origin, being (when not enclitic: see below, 85) the result of actual combination of an acute vowel and a following grave vowel into one syllable. It is also uniformly defined as compound in pitch, a union of higher and lower tone within the limits of a single syllable. It is thus identical in physical character with the Greek and Latin circumflex, and fully entitled to be called by the same name.\n\n82. Strictly, therefore, there is but one distinction of tone in the Sanskrit accentual system, as described by the native grammarians and marked in the written texts: the accented syllable is raised in tone above the unaccented; while then further, in certain cases of the fusion of an accented and an unaccented element into one syllable, that syllable retains the compounded tone of both elements.\n\n83. The svarita or circumflex is only rarely found on a pure long vowel or diphthong, but almost always on a syllable in which a vowel, short or long, is preceded by a y or v representing an originally acute i- or u-vowel.\n\na. In transliteration, in this work, the ud\u0101tta or acute will be marked with the ordinary sign of the acute, and the svarita or circumflex (as being a downward slide of the voice forward) with what is usually called the grave accent: thus, \u00e1, acute, y\u00e0 or v\u00e0, circumflex.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235326":{"pageid":235326,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/57","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>84.

K\u1e63\u0101ipra (''quick''), when an acute i- or u-vowel (short or long) is converted into y or v before a dissimilar vowel of grave tone: thus, vy\u0101\u0300pta from v\u00ed-\u0101pta, apsv\u00e0nt\u00e1r from aps\u00fa ant\u00e1r.\n\nb. J\u0101tya (''native'') or nitya (''own''), when the same combination lies further back, in the make-up of a stem or form, and so is constant, or belongs to the word in all circumstances of its occurrence: thus, kv\u00e0 (from k\u00faa), sv\u00e0r (s\u00faar), ny\u00e0k (n\u00edak), budhny\u00e0 (budhn\u00eda), kany\u0101\u0300 (kan\u00ed\u0101), nady\u00e0s (nad\u012b\u0301-as), tanv\u0101\u0300 (tan\u016b\u0301-\u0101).\n\nc. The words of both the above classes are in the Veda, in the great majority of cases, to be read with restoration of the acute vowel as a separate syllable; thus, aps\u00fa ant\u00e1r, s\u00faar, nad\u012b\u0301as, etc. In some texts, part of them are written correspondingly, thus, s\u00favar, tan\u00fav\u0101, budhn\u00edya.\n\nd. Pra\u00e7li\u1e63\u1e6da, when the acute and grave vowels are of such character that they are fused into a long vowel or diphthong (128 c): thus, div\u012b\u0300 \u2019va (RV. AV. etc.), from div\u00ed iva; s\u016b\u0300dg\u0101t\u0101 (TS.), from s\u00fa-udg\u0101t\u0101; n\u0101\u00ec \u2019v\u0101\u0300 \u2019\u00e7n\u012by\u0101t (\u00c7B.), from n\u00e1 ev\u00e1 a\u00e7n\u012by\u0101t.\n\ne. Abhinihita, when an initial grave a is absorbed by a final acute \u00e9 or \u00f3 (135 a): thus, t\u00e8 \u2019bruvan, from t\u00e9 abruvan; s\u00f2 \u2019brav\u012bt, from s\u00f3 abrav\u012bt.\n\n85. But further, the Hindu grammarians agree in declaring the (naturally grave) syllable following an acute, whether in the same or in another word, to be svarita or circumflex \u2014 unless, indeed, it be itself followed by an acute or circumflex; in which case it retains its grave tone. This is called by European scholars the enclitic or dependent circumflex.\n\na. Thus, in t\u00e9na and t\u00e9 ca, the syllable na and word ca are regarded and marked as circumflex; but in t\u00e9na t\u00e9 and t\u00e9 ca sv\u00e0r they are grave.\n\nb. This seems to mean that the voice, which is borne up at the higher pitch to the end of the acute syllable, does not ordinarily drop to grave pitch by an instantaneous movement, but descends by a more or less perceptible slide in the course of the following syllable. No Hindu authority suggests the theory of a middle or intermediate tone for the enclitic, any more than for the independent circumflex. For the most part, the two are identified with one another, in treatment and designation. The enclitic circumflex is likewise divided into a number of sub-varieties, with different names: they are of too little consequence to be worth reporting.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235327":{"pageid":235327,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/58","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>86. The essential difference of the two kinds of circumflex is shown clearly enough by these facts: 1. the independent circumflex takes the place of the acute as the proper accent of a word, while the enclitic is the mere shadow following an acute, and following it in another word precisely as in the same word; 2. the independent circumflex maintains its character in all situations, while the enclitic before a following circumflex or acute loses its circumflex character, and becomes grave; moreover, 3. in many of the systems of marking accent (below, 88), the two are quite differently indicated.</p>\n\n87. The accentuation is marked in manuscripts only of the older literature: namely, in the primary Vedic texts, or sa\u1e41hit\u0101s, in two of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as (T\u0101ittir\u012bya and \u00c7atapatha), in the T\u0101ittir\u012bya-\u0100ra\u1e47yaka, in certain passages of the \u0100itareya-\u0100ra\u1e47yaka, and in the Supar\u1e47\u0101dhy\u0101ya. There are a number of methods of writing accent, more or less different from one another; the one found in manuscripts of the Rig-Veda, which is most widely known, and of which most of the others are only slight modifications, is as follows.\n\na. The acute syllable is left unmarked; the circumflex, whether independent or enclitic, has a short perpendicular stroke above; and the grave next preceding an acute or (independent) circumflex has a short horizontal stroke below. Thus,\n\n<center>\u0905\u0952\u0917\u094d\u0928\u093f\u092e\u094d agn\u00edm; \u091c\u0941\u0952\u0939\u094b\u0924\u093f\u0951 juh\u00f3ti; \u0924\u0952\u0928\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0951 tanv\u0101\u0300; \u0915\u094d\u0935\u0951 kv\u00e0.</center>\n\nb. But the introductory grave stroke below cannot be given if an acute syllable is initial; hence an unmarked syllable at the beginning of a word is to be understood as acute; and hence also, if several grave syllables precede an acute at the beginning of a sentence, they must all alike have the grave sign. Thus,\n\n<center>\u0907\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0903\u0951 \u00edndra\u1e25; \u0924\u0947 t\u00e9; \u0915\u0952\u0930\u093f\u0952\u0937\u094d\u092f\u0938\u093f\u0951 kari\u1e63y\u00e1si; \u0924\u0941\u0952\u0935\u093f\u0952\u091c\u093e\u0952\u0924\u093e tuvij\u0101t\u0101\u0301.</center>\n\nc. All the grave syllables, however, which follow a marked circumflex are left unmarked, until the occurrence of another accented syllable causes the one which precedes it to take the preparatory stroke below.

The accent-marks are written with red ink in the manuscripts, being added after the text is written, and perhaps often by another hand.\n\n88. a. Nearly accordant with this, the Rig-Veda method of designating accent, are the methods employed in the manuscripts of the Atharva-Veda, of the V\u0101jasaneyi-Sa\u1e41hit\u0101, and of the T\u0101ittir\u012bya-Sa\u1e41hit\u0101, Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, and \u0100ra\u1e47yaka. Their differences from it are of trifling importance, consisting mainly in peculiar ways of marking the circumflex that precedes an acute (87 d). In some manuscripts of the Atharva-Veda, the accent-marks are dots instead of strokes, and that for the circumflex is made within the syllable instead of above it.\n\nb. In most manuscripts of the M\u0101itr\u0101ya\u1e47\u012b-Sa\u1e41hit\u0101, the acute syllable itself, besides its surroundings, is marked \u2014 namely, by a perpendicular stroke above the syllable (like that of the ordinary circumflex in the RV. method). The independent circumflex has a hook beneath the syllable, and the circumflex before an acute (87 d) is denoted simply by a figure 3, standing before instead of after the circumflexed syllable.\n\nc. The \u00c7atapatha-Br\u0101hma\u1e47a uses only a single accent-sign, the horizontal stroke beneath the syllable (like the mark for grave in RV.). This is put under an acute, or, if two or more acutes immediately follow one another, only under the preceding syllable. To mark an independent circumflex, it is put under the preceding syllable. The method is an imperfect one, allowing many ambiguities.\n\nd. The S\u0101ma-Veda method is the most intricate of all. It has a dozen different signs, consisting of figures, or of figures and letters combined, all placed above the syllables, and varying according to both the accentual character of the syllable and to its surroundings. Its origin is obscure; if anything more is indicated by it then by the other simpler systems, the fact has not been demonstrated.\n\n89. In this work, as everything given in the devan\u0101gar\u012b characters is also given in transliteration, it will generally be unnecessary to mark the accent except in the transliterated form; where, however, the case is otherwise, there will be adopted the method of marking only the really accented syllables, the acute and the independent circumflex: the latter by the usually svarita-sign, the former by a small u (for ud\u0101tta) above the syllable: thus,\n\n[[Image:Indra udatta accent method.png|20px]] \u00edndra, [[Image:Agne udatta accent method.png|20px]] \u00e1gne, \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0951\u0930\u094d sv\u00e0r, \u0928\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0951\u0938 nady\u00e0s.\n\na.

The theory of the Sanskrit accent, as here given (a consistent and intelligible body of phenomena), has been overlaid by the Hindu theorists, especially of the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas, with a number of added features, of a much more questionable character. Thus:</p>\n\na. The unmarked grave syllables following a circumflex (either at the end of a sentence, or till the near aproach of another acute) are declared to have the same high tone with the (also unmarked) acute. They are called pracaya or pracita (''accumulated'': because liable to occur in an indefinite series of successive syllables).\n\nb. The circumflex, whether independent or enclitic, is declared to begin on a higher pitch than acute, and to descend to acute pitch in ordinary cases: the concluding instant of it being brought down to grave pitch, however, in the case of an independent circumflex which is immediately followed by another ascent of the voice to higher pitch, in acute or independent circumflex (a kampa syllable: 87 d).\n\nc. P\u0101\u1e47ini gives the ambiguous name of eka\u00e7ruti (''monotone'') to the pracita syllables, and says nothing of the uplifting of the circumflex to a higher plane; he teaches, however, a depression below the grave pitch for the marked grave syllable before acute or circumflex, calling it sannatara (otherwise anud\u0101ttatara).\n\n91. The system of accentuation as marked in the Vedic texts appears to have assumed in the traditional recitation of the Brahmanic schools a peculiar and artificial form, in which the designated syllables, grave and circumflex (equally the enclitic and the independent circumflex), have acquired a conspicuous value, while the undesignated, the acute, has sunk into insignificance.\n\n92. The Sanskrit accent taught in the native grammars and represented by the accentuated texts is essentially a system of word-accent only. No general attempt is made (any more than in the Greek system) to define or mark a sentence-accent, the effect of the emphasis and modulation of the sentence in modifying the independent accent of individual words. The only approach to it is seen in the treatment of vocatives and personal verb-forms.\n\na. A vocative is usually without accent except at the beginning of a sentence: for further details, see 314.\n\nb. A personal verb-form is usually accentless in an independent-clause, except when standing at the beginning of the clause: for further details, see 591 ff.\n\n93. Certain other words also are, usually or always, without accent.\n\na. The particles ca, v\u0101, u, sma, iva, cid, svid, ha, and the Vedic kam (or k\u00e1m), gha, bhala, samaha, \u012bm, s\u012bm, are always without accent; also yath\u0101 in RV.

An accentless word is not allowed to stand at the beginning of a sentence; also not of a p\u0101da or primary division of a verse; a p\u0101da is, in all matters relating to accentuation, treated like an independent sentence.\n\n94. Some words have more than a single accented syllable. Such are:\n\na. Certain dual copulative compounds in the Veda (see 1255), as mitr\u0101\u0301v\u00e1ru\u1e47\u0101, dy\u0101\u0301v\u0101p\u1e5bthiv\u012b\u0301.

Infinitive datives in tav\u0101\u00ed (see 972 a), as \u00e9tav\u0101\u00ed, \u00e1pabhartav\u0101\u00ed.\n\nd. A word naturally barytone, but having its final syllable protracted (see 78 a).\n\ne. The particle v\u0101\u0301v\u00e1 (in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as).\n\n95. On the place of the accented syllable in a Sanskrit word there is no restriction whatever depending upon either the number or the quantity of the preceding or following syllables. The accent rests where the rules of inflection or derivation or composition place it, without regard to any thing else.\n\na. Thus, \u00edndre, agn\u0101\u00fa, \u00edndre\u1e47a, agn\u00edn\u0101, agnin\u0101\u0301m, b\u0101h\u00facyuta, \u00e1napacyuta, parj\u00e1nyajinvita, abhim\u0101ti\u1e63\u0101h\u00e1, \u00e1nabhiml\u0101tavar\u1e47a, abhi\u00e7astic\u0101\u0301tana, h\u00edra\u1e47yav\u0101\u00e7\u012bmattama, c\u00e1tu\u00e7catv\u0101ri\u1e45\u00e7adak\u1e63ara.\n\n96. Since the accent is marked only in the older literature, and the statements of the grammarians, with the deduced rules of accentuation, are far from being sufficient to settle in all cases, the place of the stress of voice for a considerable part of the vocabulary is undetermined.

The words in Sanskrit, as in the other languages related with it, are in great part analysable into roots, suffixes of derivation, and endings of inflection, these last being added mostly to stems containing suffixes, but also sometimes directly to roots.\n\na. There are, of course, a certain number of uninflected words\u2014indeclinables, particles; and also not a few that are incapable of analysis.\n\n99. The Sanskrit, indeed, possesses an exceptionally analysable character; its formative processes are more regular and transparent than those of any other Indo-European tongue. Hence the prevailing method of the Hindu native science of grammar, which sets up a certain body of roots, and prescribes the processes by which these may be made stems and words, giving the various added elements, and laying down the rules by which their combination is effected. And the same general method is, for like reasons, followed also by European grammarians.\n\n100. The euphonic-laws, accordingly, which govern the combination of suffix or of ending with root or stem, possess a high practical importance, and require to be laid down in preparation for topics of declension and conjugation.\n\n101. Moreover, the formation of compounds, by joining two or more simple stems, is extremely frequent in Sanskrit; and this kind of combination has its own peculiar euphonic rules. And once more, in the form of the language as handed down to us by its literature, the words composing a sentence or paragraph are adapted to and combined with one another by nearly the same rules which govern the making of compounds; so that it is impossible to take apart and understand a Sanskrit sentence without knowing those rules.

This euphonic interdependence of the words of a sentence is unknown to any other language in anything like the same degree; and it cannot but be suspected of being at least in part artificial, implying an erection into necessary and invariable rules of what in the living language were only optional practices. This is strongly indicated, indeed, by the evidence of the older dialect of the Vedas and of the derived Prakritic dialects, in both of which some of the rules (especially that as to the hiatus: see 113) are often violated.\n\n102. The roots which are authenticated by their occurrence in the literary monuments of the language, earlier and later, number between eight and nine hundred. About half of these belong fully to the language throughout its whole history; some (about a hundred and fifty) are limited to the earlier or pre-classical period; some, again (over a hundred and twenty), make their first appearance in the later language.\n\na. There are in this number roots of very diverse character. Those occurring only later are, at least in great part, presumably of secondary origin; and a certain number are even doubtless artificial, used once or twice because found in the root-lists of the Hindu grammarians (103). But also of the rest, some are plainly secondary, while others are questionable; and not a few are variations or differentiated forms of one another. Thus, there are roots showing respectively r and l, as rabh and labh, mruc and mluc, k\u1e63ar and k\u1e63al; roots with and without a strengthening nasal, as vand and vad, mand and mad; roots in \u0101 and in a nasal, as kh\u0101 and khan, g\u0101 and gam, j\u0101 and jan; roots made by an added \u0101, as tr\u0101 from t\u1e5b, mn\u0101 from man, ps\u0101 from bhas, y\u0101 from i; roots the product of reduplication, as jak\u1e63 from ghas, dudh from dh\u016b; roots with a final sibilant of formative origin, as bhak\u1e63 and bhik\u1e63 from bhaj, nak\u1e63 from na\u00e7, \u00e7ru\u1e63 from \u00e7ru, h\u0101s from h\u0101; root-forms held apart by a well-established discordance of inflection and meaning, which yet are probably different sides of one root, as k\u1e5b\u1e63 ''drag'' and k\u1e5b\u1e63 ''plough', vid ''know'' and vid ''find'', v\u1e5b ''enclose'' and v\u1e5b ''choose''; and so on. In many such cases it is doubtful whether we ought to acknowledge two roots or only one; and no absolute rule of distinction can be laid down and maintained.\n\n103. The list of roots given by the Hindu grammarians contains about two thousand roots, without including all those which students of the language are compelled to recognize. Considerably more than half of this number, then, are unauthenticated by use; and although some of these may yet come to light, or may have existed without finding their way into any of the preserved literary documents, it is certain that most are fictitious; made in part for the explanation of words falsely described as their derivatives, but in the main for unknown and perhaps undiscoverable reasons.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235426":{"pageid":235426,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/64","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>a. The roots unauthenticated by traceable use will be made no account of in this grammar\u2014or, if noticed, will be specified as of that character.</p>\n\n104. The forms of the roots as here used will be found to differ in certain respects from those given by the native grammarians and adopted by some European works. Thus:\n\na. Those roots of which the initial n and s are regularly converted to \u1e47 and \u1e63 after certain prefixes are by the Hindu grammarians given as beginning with \u1e47 and \u1e63; no western authority follows this example.\n\nb. The Hindus classify as simple roots a number of derived stems: reduplicated ones, as d\u012bdh\u012b, j\u0101g\u1e5b, daridr\u0101; present-stems, as \u016br\u1e47u; and denominative stems, as avadh\u012br, kum\u0101r, sabh\u0101g, mantr, s\u0101ntv, arth, and the like. These are in European works generally reduced to their true value.\n\nc. A number of roots ending in an \u0101 which is irregularly treated in the present-system are written in the Hindu lists with diphthongs \u2014 e or \u0101i or o; here they will be regarded as \u0101-roots (see 251). The o of such root-forms, especially, is purely arbitrary; no forms or derivatives made from the roots justify it.\n\nd. The roots showing interchangeably \u1e5b and ir and \u012br or ur and \u016br (242) are written by the Hindus with \u1e5b or with \u1e5d, or with both. The \u1e5d here also is only formal, intended to mark the roots as liable to certain modifications, since it nowhere shows itself in any form or derivative. Such roots will in this work be written with \u1e5b.\n\ne. The roots, on the other hand, showing a variation between \u1e5b and ar (rarely ra) as weak and strong forms will be here written with \u1e5b, as by the native grammarians, although many European authorities prefer the other or strong form. So long as we write the unstrengthened vowel in vid and \u00e7\u012b, in mud and bh\u016b, and their like, consistency seems to be require that we write it in s\u1e5bj and k\u1e5b also\u2014in all cases alike, without reference to what may have been the more original Indo-European form.\n\n105. In many cases of roots showing more than one form, the selection of a representative form is a matter of comparative indifference. To deal with such cases according to their historical character is the part rather of an Indo-European comparative grammar than of a Sanskrit grammar. We must be content to accept as roots what elements seem to have on the whole that value in the existing condition of the language.\n\n106. Stems as well as roots have their variations of form (311). The Hindu grammarians usually give the weaker form as the normal one, and derive the other from it by a strengthening change; some European authorities do the same, while others prefer the contrary method; the choice is of unessential consequence, and may be determined in any case by motives of convenience.\n\n107.

The formation of conjugational stems (tense and mode-stems; also participles and infinitive) will be taught, as is usual, in connection with the processes of conjugational inflection; that of uninflected words, in connection with the various classes of those words. But the general subject of derivation, or the formation of declinable stems, will be taken up by itself later (chap. XVII.); and it will be followed by an account of the formation of compound stems (chap. XVIII.).\n\n108. It is by no means to be expected of beginners in the language that they will attempt to master the rules of euphonic combination in a body, before going on to learn the paradigms of inflection. On the contrary, the leading paradigms of declension may best be learned outright, without attention, or with only a minimum of attention, to euphonic rule. In taking up conjugation, however, it is practically, as well as theoretically, better to learn the forms as combinations of stem and ending, with attention to such laws of combination as apply in the particular cases concerned. The rules of external combination, governing the make-up of the sentence out of words, should be grappled with only when the student is prepared to begin the reading or the formation of sentences.\n\n<center>Principles of Euphonic Combination.</center>\n\n109. The rules of combination (sa\u1e41dhi 'putting together'') are in some respects different, according as they apply\u2014\n\na. to the internal make-up of a word, by the addition of derivative and inflectional endings to roots and stems;\n\nb. to the more external putting together of stems to make compound stems, and the yet looser and more accidental collocation of words in the sentence;\n\nc. Hence they are usually divided into rules of internal combination, and rules of external combination.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235428":{"pageid":235428,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/66","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>110. In both classes of cases, however, the general principles of combination are the same\u2014and likewise, to a great extent, the specific rules. The differences depend in part on the occurrence or non-occurrence of certain combinations in the one class or the other; in part, on the difference of treatment of the same sound as final of a root or of an ending, the former being more persistent than the latter; in part, on the occurrence in external combination of certain changes which are apparently phonetic but really historical; and, most frequent and conspicuous of all, on the fact that (157) vowels and semivowels and nasals exercise a sonantizing influence in external combination, but not in internal. Hence, to avoid unnecessary repetition as well as the separation of what really belongs together, the rules for both kinds of combination are given below in connection with one another.</p>\n\n111. a. Moreover, before case-endings beginning with bh and s (namely bhy\u0101m, bhis, bhyas, su), the treatment of the finals of stems is in general the same as in the combinations of words (pada) with one another\u2014whence those endings are sometimes called pada-endings, and the cases they form are known as pada-cases.\n\nb. The importance of this distinction in somewhat exaggerated by the ordinary statement of it. In fact, dh is the only sonant mute initial of an ending occurring in conjugation, as bh in declension; and the difference of their treatment is in part owing to the one coming into collision usually with the final of a root and the other of an ending, and in part to the fact that dh, as a dental, is more assimilable to palatals and linguals than bh. A more marked and problematic distinction is made between su and the verbal endings si, sva, etc., especially after palatal sounds and \u1e63.\n\nc. Further, before certain of the suffixes of derivation the final of a stem is sometimes treated in the same manner as that of a word in composition.\n\nd. This is especially the case before secondary suffixes having a markedly distinct office, like the possessive mant and vant, the abstract-making tva, the suffix of material maya, and so on; and it is much more frequent in the later language than in the earlier. The examples are sporadic in character, and no rule can be given to cover them: for details, see the various suffixes, in chap. XVII. In the RV. (as may be mentioned here) the only examples are vidy\u00fanmant (beside gar\u00fatmant, kak\u00fadmant, etc.), p\u1e5b\u0301\u1e63advant (beside datv\u00e1nt, mar\u00fatvant, etc.), dh\u1e5b\u1e63adv\u00edn (beside namasv\u00edn etc.), and aha\u1e41y\u00fa, ki\u1e41y\u00fa, \u00e7a\u1e41y\u00fa, and a\u1e45hoy\u00fa, duvoy\u00fa, \u00e1sk\u1e5bdhoyu (beside namasy\u00fa, vacasy\u00fa, etc.); and the AV. adds only s\u00e1hovan (RV. sav\u0101\u0301van).\n\n112.

Then, however, they are indispensable, since the proper form of the words that compose the sentence is not to be determined without them.\n\na. The general principles of combination underlying the euphonic rules, and determining their classification, may be stated as follows:\n\n113. Hiatus. In general, hiatus is forbidden; every syllable except the initial one of a sentence, or of a word or phrase not forming part of a sentence, must begin with a consonant (or with more than one).\n\na. For details, and for exceptions, see 125 ff.\n\nb. In the earlier language, however, hiatus in every position was abundantly admitted. This appears plainly from the ''mantras'', or metrical parts of the Veda, where in innumerable instances y and v are to be read as i and u, and, less often, a long vowel is to be resolved into two vowels, in order to make good the metre; e.g. v\u0101ry\u0101\u1e47\u0101m has to be read as v\u0101-ri-\u0101-\u1e47a-\u0101m, sva\u00e7vyam as su-a\u00e7-vi-am, and so on. In the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, also, we find tvac, svar, dy\u0101us described as dissyllables, vy\u0101na and satyam as trisyllables, r\u0101janya as of four syllables, and the like. See further 129 e.\n\n114. Deaspiration. An aspirate mute is liable to lose its aspiration, being allowed to stand unchanged only before a vowel or semivowel or nasal.\n\n115. Assimilation. The great body of euphonic changes in Sanskrit, as elsewhere, falls under the general head of assimilation\u2014which takes place both between sounds which are so nearly alike that the difference between them is too insignificant to be worth preserving, and between those which are so diverse as to be practically incompatible.\n\n116. In part, assimilation involves the conversion of one sound to another of the same series, without change of articulating position; in part, it involves a change of position, or transfer to another series.\n\n117. Of changes within the series, the most frequent and important occur in the adaptation of surd and sonant sounds to one<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235431":{"pageid":235431,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/68","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>another; but the nasals and l have also in certain cases their special assimilative influence. Thus:\n\na. In the two classes of non-nasal mutes and spirants, surd and sonant are wholly incompatible; no surd of either class can either precede or follow a sonant of either.\n\nb. A mute, surd or sonant, is assimilated by being changed to its correspondent of the other kind; of the spirants, the surd s is the only one having a sonant correspondent, namely r, to which it is convertible in external combination (164 ff.).\n\nc. The nasals are more freely combinable: a nasal may either precede or follow a mute of either kind, or the sonant spirant h; it may also follow a surd aspirant (sibilant); no nasal, however, ever precedes a sibilant in the interior of a word (it is changed instead to anusv\u0101ra); and in external combination their concurrence is usually avoided by insertion of a surd mute.\n\nd. A semivowel has still less sonantizing influence; and a vowel least of all: both are freely preceded and followed by sounds of every other class, in the interior of a word.\n\ne. Before a sibilant, however, is found, of the semivowels, only r and very rarely l. Moreover, in external combination, r is often changed to its surd correspondent s.\n\nBut\n\nf. In composition and sentence-collocation, initial vowels and semivowels and nasals also require the preceding final to be sonant. And\n\ng. Before a nasal and l, the assimilative process is sometimes carried further, by the conversion of a final mute to a nasal or l respectively.\n\n118. Of conversions involving a change of articulate position, the most important are those of dental sounds to lingual, and, less often, to palatal. Thus:\n\na. The dental s and n are very frequently converted to \u1e63 and \u1e47 by the assimilating influence of contiguous or neighboring lingual sounds: the s, even by sounds\u2014namely, i- and u-vowels and k\u2014which have themselves no lingual character.\n\nb. A non-nasal dental mute is (with a few exceptions in external combination) made lingual when it comes into collision with a lingual sound.\n\nc. The dental mutes and sibilant are made palatal by a contiguous palatal.\n\nBut also:\n\nd. A m (not radical) is assimilated to a following consonant, of whatever kind.\n\ne. For certain anomalous cases, see 151.\n\n119.

The lingual sibilant \u1e63, also of derivative character (from dental s), shows as radical final peculiar and problematic phenomena of combination.\n\n121. Extension and abbreviation of consonant-groups. The native grammarians allow or require certain extensions, by duplication or insertion, of groups of consonants. And, on the other hand, abbreviation of certain other groups is allowed, and found often practised in the manuscripts.\n\n122. Permitted Finals. The permitted occurrence of consonants at the end of a word is quite narrowly restricted. In general, only one consonant is allowed after the last vowel; and that must be neither the aspiration, nor a sibilant, nor a semivowel (save rarely \u0932\u094d l), nor an aspirate mute, nor a sonant mute if not nasal, nor a palatal.\n\n123. Increment and Decrement. Besides these more or less regular changes accompanying the combination of the parts that make up words, there is another class of a different character, not consisting in the mutual adaptations of the parts, but in strengthening or weakening changes of the parts themselves.\n\n124. It is impossible to carry through a perfectly systematic arrangement of the detailed rules of euphonic combination, because the different varieties of euphonic change more or less overlap and intersect one another. The order observed below will be as follows:\n\n1. Rules of vowel combination, for the avoidance of hiatus.\n\n2. Rules as to permitted finals (since these underlie the further treatment of final consonants in external combination).\n\n3. Rules for loss of aspiration of an aspirate mute.\n\n4.

The concurrence of two vowels, or of vowel and diphthong, without intervening consonant, is forbidden by the euphony of the later or classical language. It is avoided, according to the circumstances of the case, either by fusion of the two concurrent sounds into one, by the reduction of one of them to a semivowel, or by development of a semivowel between them.\n\na. For the not infrequent cases of composition and sentence-combination in which the recent loss of a s or y or v between vowels leave a permanent hiatus, see below, 132 ff., 175\u20137; for certain final vowels which are maintained unchanged in sentence-combination before an initial vowel, see 138.\n\nb. A very few words in their admitted written form show interior hiatus; such are t\u00edta\u00fc ''sieve'' (perhaps for titasu, BR.), pr\u00e1\u00fcga ''wagon-pole'' (for prayuga); and, in RV., su\u016bt\u00ed.\n\nc. The texts of the older dialect are written according to the euphonic rules of the later language, although in them (see 113 b) the hiatus is really of frequent occurrence. Hence they are not to be read as written, but with constantly recurring reversal of the processes of vowel-combination which they have been made artificially to undergo. See further 129 e.\n\nd. Also in the later language, hiatus between the two p\u0101das or primary divisions of a metrical line is tolerably frequent, and it is not unknown in sporadic cases even in the interior of a p\u0101da.\n\ne.

As regards the accent of these vowel combinations, it is to be noticed that, 1. as a matter of course, the union of acute with acute yields acute, and that of grave with grave yields grave; that of circumflex with circumflex cannot occur; 2. a circumflex with following acute yields acute, the final grave element of the former being raised to acute pitch; a grave with following acute does the same, as no upward slide of the voice on a syllable is acknowledged in the language; but, 3. when the former of the fused elements is acute and the latter grave, we might expect the resulting syllable to be in general circumflex, to represent both the original tones. P\u0101\u1e47ini in fact allows this accent in every such case; and in a single accented Br\u0101hma\u1e47a text (\u00c7B.), the circumflex is regularly written. But the language shows, on the whole, an indisposition to allow the circumflex to rest on either long vowel or diphthong as its sole basis, and the acute element is suffered to raise the other to its own level of pitch, making the whole syllable acute. The only exception to this, in most of the texts, is the combination of \u00ed and i, which becomes \u012b\u0300: thus, div\u012b\u0300 \u2019va, from div\u00ed iva; in the T\u0101ittir\u012bya texts alone such a case follows the general rule, while \u00fa and u, instead, make \u016b\u0300: thus, s\u016b\u0300dg\u0101t\u0101 from s\u00fa-udg\u0101t\u0101.</p>\n\n129. The i-vowels, the u-vowels, and \u090b \u1e5b, before a dissimilar vowel or diphthong, are regularly converted each into its own corresponding semivowel, \u092f\u094d y or \u0935\u094d v or \u0930\u094d r. Examples are:\n\n\u0907\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0939 ity \u0101ha (iti + \u0101ha);\n\n\u092e\u0927\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0935 madhv iva (madhu + iva);\n\n\u0926\u0941\u0939\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947 duhitrarthe (duhit\u1e5b-arthe);\n\n\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0938\u094d\u092f stry asya (str\u012b + asya);\n\n\u0935\u0927\u094d\u0935\u0948 vadhv\u0101i (vadh\u016b-\u0101i).\n\na. But in internal combination the i and u-vowels are not seldom changed instead to iy and uv\u2014and this especially in monosyllables, or after two constants, where otherwise a group of consonants difficult of pronunciation would be the result. The cases will be noticed below, in explaining inflected forms.\n\nb. A radical i-vowel is converted into y even before i in perfect tense-inflection, so ninyima (nin\u012b + ima).\n\nc. In a few sporadic cases, i and u become iy and uv even in word-composition: e.g., triyavi (tri + avi), viyan\u0304ga (vi + an\u0304ga), suvita (su + ita): compare 1204 b, c.\n\nd.

For the most part, doubtless, these are only two ways of writing the same pronunciation, s\u00fa-ar, budhn\u00eda, and so on; and the discordance has no other importance, historical or phonetic. There is more or less of this difference of treatment of an i- or u-element after a consonant in all periods of the language.\n\ne. In the elder language, there is a marked difference, in respect to the frequency of vowel-combination for avoiding hiatus as compared with that of non-combination and consequent hiatus, between the class of cases where two vowel-sounds, similar or dissimilar, would coalesce into one (126, 127) and that where an i- or u-vowel would be converted into a semivowel. Thus, in word-composition, the ratio of the cases of coalesced vowels to those of hiatus are in RV. as five to one, in AV. as nineteen to one, while in the cases of semivowel-conversion are in RV. only one in twelve, in AV. only one in five; in sentence-combination, the cases of coalescence are in both RV. and AV. about as seven to one, while those of semivowel-conversion are in RV. only one in fifty, in AV. one in five.\n\nf. For certain cases of the loss or assimilation of i and u before y and v respectively, see 233 a.\n\n130. As regards the accent\u2014here, as in the preceding case (128), the only combination requiring notice is that of an acute i- or u- vowel with a following grave: the result is circumflex; and such cases of circumflex are many times more frequent than any and all others. Examples are:\n\n\u0935\u094d\u092f\u0941\u0951\u0937\u094d\u0924\u093f vy\u00f9\u1e63\u1e6di (v\u00ed-u\u1e63\u1e6di); \u0905\u092d\u094d\u092f\u0951\u0930\u094d\u091a\u0924\u093f abhy\u00e0rcati;\n\n\u0928\u0926\u094d\u092f\u094c\u0951 nady\u0101\u00f9 (nad\u00ed-\u0101u);\n\n\u0938\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0951\u0937\u094d\u091f sv\u00ec\u1e63\u1e6da (s\u00fa-i\u1e63\u1e6da); \u0924\u0928\u094d\u0935\u0951\u0938\u094d tanv\u00e0s (tan\u016b\u0301-as).\n\na. Of a similar combination of acute \u1e5b\u0301 with following grave, only a single case has been noted in accented texts: namely, vij\u00f1\u0101tr \u00e8t\u00e1t (i.e. vij\u00f1\u0101t\u1e5b\u0301 et\u00e1t: \u00c7B. xiv. 6. 8<sup>11</sup>); the accentuation is in accordance with the rules for i and u.\n\n131. Of a diphthong, the final i- or u-element is changed to its corresponding semivowel, \u092f\u094d y and \u0935\u094d v, before any vowel or diphthong: thus, \u090f e (really ai: 28 a) becomes \u0905\u092f\u094d ay, and \u0913 o (that is, au: 28 a) becomes \u0905\u0935\u094d av; \u0910 \u0101i becomes \u0906\u092f\u094d \u0101y, and \u0914 \u0101u becomes \u0906\u0935\u094d \u0101v.\n\na. No change of accent, of course, occurs here; each original syllable retains its syllabic identity, and hence also its own tone.\n\nb.

The latter grammarians allow the y in such combinations to be either retained or dropped; but the uniform practice of the manuscripts, of every age, in accordance with the strict requirement of the Vedic grammars (Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas), is to omit the semivowel and leave the hiatus.\n\nb. The persistence of the hiatus caused by this omission is a plain indication of the comparatively recent loss of the intervening consonantal sound.\n\nc. Instances, however, of the avoidance of hiatus by combination of the remaining final vowel with the following initial according to the usual rules are met with in every period of the language, from the RV. down; but they are rare and of sporadic character.

The diphthong o (except as phonetic alteration of final as: see 175 a) is an unusual final, appearing only in the stem go (361 c), in the voc. sing. of u-stems (341), in words of which the final a is combined with the particle u, as atho, and in a few interjections. In the last two classes it is uncombinable (below, 138 c,f); the vocatives sometimes retain the v and sometimes lose it (the practices of different texts are too different to be briefly stated); go (in composition only) does not ordinarily lose its final element, but remains gav or go. A final as becomes a, with following hiatus, before any vowel save a (for which, see the next paragraph).<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235439":{"pageid":235439,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/75","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>b.

As to the use of the avagraha sign in the case of such an elision, see above, 16. In transliteration, the reversed apostrophe, or rough breathing, will be used in this work to represent it.\n\nc. This elision or absorption of initial a after final e or o, which in the later language is the invariable rule, is in the Veda only an occasional occurrence. Thus, in the RV., out of nearly 4500 instances of such an initial a, it is, as the metre shows, to be really omitted only about seventy times; in the AV., less than 300 times out of about 1600. In neither work is there any accordance in respect to the combination in question between the written and the spoken form of the text: in RV., the a is (as written) elided in more than three quarters of the cases; in the AV., in about two thirds; and in both it is written in a number of instances where the metre requires its omission.\n\nd. In a few cases, an initial \u0101 is thus elided, especially that of \u0101tman.\n\ne. To the rules of vowel combination, as above stated, there are certain exceptions. Some of the more isolated of these will be<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235440":{"pageid":235440,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/76","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>noticed where they come up in the processes of inflection etc.; a few require mention here.\n\n13. In internal combination:\n\na. The augment a makes with the initial vowel of a root the combinations \u0101i, \u0101u, \u0101r (v\u1e5bddhi-vowels: 235), instead of e, o, ar (gu\u1e47a-vowels), as required by 127; thus, \u0101ita (a + ita), \u0101ubhn\u0101t (a + ubhn\u0101t), \u0101rdhnot (a + \u1e5bdhnot).\n\nb. The final o of a stem (1203a) becomes av before the suffix ya (original ia: 1210a).\n\nc. The final vowel of a stem is often dropped when a secondary suffix is added (1203a).\n\nd. For the weakening and loss of radical vowels, and for certain insertions, see below, 249 ff., 257\u20138.\n\n137. In external combination:\n\na. The final a or \u0101 of a preposition, with initial \u1e5b of a root, makes \u0101r instead of ar: Thus, \u0101rchati (\u0101 + \u1e5bchati), av\u0101rchati (ava + \u1e5bchati), up\u0101r\u1e63ati (\u00c7B.: upa + \u1e5b\u1e63ati; but A.V. upar\u1e63anti).\n\nb. Instances are occasionally met with a final a or \u0101 being lost entirely before initial e or o: thus, in verb-forms, av\u2019 e\u1e63y\u0101mas AB., up\u2019 e\u1e63atu etc. AV.; in derivatives, as upetavya, upet\u1e5b; in compounds, as da\u00e7oni, yathetam, and (permissibly) compounds with o\u1e63\u1e6dha (not rare), otu (not quotable), odana, as adharo\u1e63\u1e6dha or adhar\u0101u\u1e63\u1e6dha, tilodana or til\u0101udana; and even in sentence-combination, as iv\u2019 etayas, a\u00e7vin\u2019 eva, yath\u2019 oci\u1e63e (all RV.), tv\u2019 odman B.; and always with the exclamation om or o\u1e41k\u00e1ra.\n\nc. The form \u016bh from \u221avah sometimes makes the heavier or v\u1e5bddhi (235) diphthongal combination with a preceding a-vowel; thus, pr\u0101u\u1e0dhi, ak\u1e63\u0101uhi\u1e47\u012b (from pra + \u016b\u1e0dhi, etc.).\n\n138. Certain final vowels, moreover, are uncombinable (prag\u1e5bhya), or maintain themselves unchanged before any following vowel. Thus,\n\na. The vowels \u012b, \u016b, and e are dual endings, both of declensional and of conjugational forms. Thus, bandh\u016b \u0101s\u0101te im\u0101u; gir\u012b \u0101rohatam.\n\nb. The pronoun am\u012b (nom. pl.: 501); and the Vedic pronominal forms asm\u00e9, yu\u1e63m\u00e9, tv\u00e9 (492 a).\n\nc. A final o made by combination of a final a-vowel with the particle u (1122b); thus, atho, mo, no.\n\nd. A final \u012b of a Vedic locative case from an i-stem (336f).\n\ne. A protracted final vowel (78).\n\nf. The final, or only, vowel of an interjection, as aho, he, \u0101, i, u.\n\ng. The older language shows occasional exceptions to these rules: thus, a dual \u012b combined with a following i, as n\u1e5bp\u00e1t\u012b \u2019va; an a elided after o, as \u00e1tho \u2018si; a locative \u012b turned into a semivowel, as v\u00e9dy asy\u0101\u0301m.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235441":{"pageid":235441,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/77","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><center>Permitted Finals.</center>\n\n139. The sounds allowed to occur as finals in Sanskrit words standing by themselves (not in euphonic combination with something following) are closely limited, and those which would etymologically come to occupy such a position are often variously altered, in general accordance with their treatment in other circumstances, or are sometimes omitted altogether.\n\na. The variety of consonants that would ever come at the end of either an inflected form or a derivation stem in the language is very small: namely, in forms, only t (or d), n, m, s; in derivative stems, only t, d, n, r, s (and, in a few rare words, j). But almost all consonants occur as finals of roots; and every root is liable to be found, alone or as last member of a compound, in the character of a declined stem.\n\n140. All the vowel sounds, both simple and diphthongal, may be sounded at the end of a word.\n\na. But neither \u1e5d nor \u1e37 ever actually occurs; and \u1e5b is rare (only as neuter sing. of a stem in \u1e5b or ar, or as final of such a stem in composition).\n\nThus, \u00edndra, \u00e7iv\u00e1y\u0101, \u00e1k\u0101ri, nad\u012b\u0301, d\u0101\u0301tu, cam\u016b\u0301, janayit\u1e5b\u0301, \u00e1gne, \u00e7iv\u0101\u0301y\u0101i, v\u0101\u0301yo, agn\u0101\u00fa.\n\n141. Of the non-nasal mutes, only the first in each series, the non-aspirate surd, is allowed; the others \u2014 surd aspirate, and both sonants \u2014 whenever they would etymologically occur, are converted into this.\n\nThus, agnim\u00e1t for agnim\u00e1th, suh\u1e5b\u0301t for suh\u1e5b\u0301d, v\u012br\u00fat for v\u012br\u00fadh, tri\u1e63\u1e6d\u00fap for tri\u1e63\u1e6d\u00fabh.\n\na. In a few roots, when their final (sonant aspirate) thus loses its aspiration, the original sonant aspiration of the initial reappears; compare \u0939\u094d h, below, 147.\n\nThus, dagh becomes dhak, budh becomes bhut, and so on.\n\nThe roots exhibiting this change are stated below, 155.\n\nb. There was some question among the Hindu grammarians as whether the final mute is to be estimated as of surd or of sonant quality; but the great weight of authority, and the invariable practice of the manuscripts, favor the surd.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235442":{"pageid":235442,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/78","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>142. The palatals, however, form here (as often elsewhere) an exception to the rules for the other mutes. No palatal is allowed as final. The \u091a\u094d c reverts (43) to its original \u0915\u094d k: thus, \u0935\u093e\u0915\u094d v\u0101\u0301k, \u0905\u0902\u0939\u094b\u092e\u0941\u0915\u094d a\u1e45hom\u00fak. The \u091b\u094d ch (only quotable in the root \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091b\u094d prach) becomes \u091f\u094d \u1e6d: thus \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u091f\u094d pr\u0101\u1e6d. The \u091c\u094d j either reverts to its original guttural or becomes \u091f\u094d \u1e6d, in accordance with its treatment in other combinations (219): thus, \u092d\u093f\u0937\u0915\u094d bhi\u1e63\u00e1k, \u0935\u093f\u0930\u093e\u091f\u094d vir\u0101\u0301\u1e6d. The \u091d\u094d jh does not occur, but it is by the native grammarians declared convertible to \u091f\u094d \u1e6d.</p>\n\n143. Of the nasals, the \u092e\u094d m and \u0928\u094d n are extremely common, especially the former (\u092e\u094d m and \u0938\u094d s are of all final consonants the most frequent); the \u0923\u094d \u1e47 is allowed, but is quite rare; \u0919\u094d n\u0304 is found (remaining after the loss of a following \u0915\u094d k) in a very small number of words (388 b, c, 407 a); \u091e\u094d \u00f1 never occurs.\n\na. But the final m of a root is changed to n (compare 212 a, below): thus, akran from kram, \u00e1gan, ajagan, agan\u012bgan from gam, \u00e1n\u0101n from nam, ay\u0101n from yam, pra\u00e7\u0101n from \u00e7am; no other cases are quotable.\n\n144. Of the semivowels, the \u0932\u094d l alone is an admitted final, and it is very rare. \u0930\u094d r is (like its nearest surd correspondent, \u0938\u094d s: 145) changed as final to visarga. Of \u092f\u094d y and \u0935\u094d v there is no occurrence.\n\n145. Of the sibilants, none may stand unaltered at the end of a word. The \u0938\u094d s (which of all final consonants would otherwise be the commonest) is, like \u0930\u094d r, changed to a breathing, the visarga. The \u0936\u094d \u00e7 either reverts (43) to its original \u0915\u094d k, or, in some roots, is changed to \u091f\u094d \u1e6d (in accordance with its changes in inflection and derivation: see below, 218): thus, \u0926\u093f\u0915\u094d dik, but \u0935\u093f\u091f\u094d vi\u1e6d. The \u0937\u094d \u1e63 is likewise changed to \u091f\u094d \u1e6d: thus, \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0943\u091f\u094d pr\u0101v\u1e5b\u1e6d.\n\na.

Final radical s is said by the grammarians to be changed to t; but no sure example of this conversion is quotable; see 168; and compare 555 a.</p>\n\n146. The compound \u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d k\u1e63 is prescribed to be treated as simple \u0937\u094d \u1e63 (not becoming \u0915\u094d k by 150, below). But the case is a rare one, and its actual treatment in the older language irregular.\n\na. In the only RV. cases where the k\u1e63 has a quasi-radical character\u2014namely an\u00e1k from an\u00e1k\u1e63, and \u00e1myak from \u221amyak\u1e63\u2014the conversion is to k. Also, of forms of the s-aorist (see 890), we have adh\u0101k, asr\u0101k, ar\u0101ik, etc. (for adh\u0101k\u1e63-t etc.); but also apr\u0101\u1e6d, ay\u0101\u1e6d, av\u0101\u1e6d, asr\u0101\u1e6d (for apr\u0101k\u1e63-t etc.). And RV. has twice ay\u0101s from \u221ayaj, and AV. twice sr\u0101s from \u221as\u1e5bj (wrongly referred by BR. to \u221asra\u1e45s), both 2d sing., where the personal ending has perhaps crowded out the root-final and tense-sign.\n\nb. The numeral \u1e63a\u1e63 six is perhaps better to be regarded as \u1e63ak\u1e63, with its k\u1e63 treated as \u1e63, according to the accepted rule.\n\n147. The aspiration \u0939\u094d h is not allowed to maintain itself, but (like \u091c\u094d j and \u0936\u094d \u00e7) either reverts to its original guttural form, appearing as \u0915\u094d k, or is changed to \u091f\u094d \u1e6d\u2014both in accordance with its treatment in inflection: see below, 222. And, also as in inflection, the original sonant aspiration of a few roots (given at 155b) reappears when their final thus becomes deaspirated. Where the \u0939\u094d h is from original \u0927\u094d dh (223e), it becomes \u0924\u094d t.\n\n148. The visarga and anusv\u0101ra are nowhere etymologically finals; the former is only the substitue for an original final \u0938\u094d s or \u0930\u094d r; the later occurs as final only so far as it is a substitute for \u092e\u094d m (213h).\n\n149. Apart from the vowels, then, the usual finals, nearly in the order of their frequency, are: \u0903 \u1e25, \u092e\u094d m, \u0928\u094d n, \u0924\u094d t, \u0915\u094d k, \u092a\u094d p, \u091f\u094d \u1e6d; those of only sporadic occurrence are \u0919\u094d n\u0304, \u0932\u094d l, \u0923\u094d \u1e47; and, by substitution, \u0902 \u1e41.\n\n150. In general, only one consonant, of whatever kind, is allowed to stand at the end of a word; if two or more would etymologically occur there, the last is dropped, and again the last, and so on, till only one remains.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235444":{"pageid":235444,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/80","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>a.

Excepting the first, these look like cases of dissimilation; yet examples of the combination bbh are not very rare in the older language: thus, kak\u00fabbhy\u0101m, tri\u1e63\u1e6d\u00fabbhis, kak\u00fabbha\u1e47\u1e0d\u00e1, anu\u1e63\u1e6d\u00fab bh\u00ed.\n\nf.

An aspirate mute is changed to a non-aspirate before another non-nasal mute or before a sibilant; it stands unaltered only before a vowel or semivowel or nasal.\n\na. Such a case can only arise in internal combination, since the processes of external combination presuppose the reduction of the aspirate to a non-aspirate surd (152).\n\nb. Practically, also, the rules as to changes of aspirates concern almost only the sonant aspirates, since the surd, being of later development and rarer occurrence, are hardly ever found in situations that call for their application.\n\n154. Hence, if such a mute is to be doubled, it is doubled by prefixing its own corresponding non-aspirate.\n\na. But in the manuscripts, both Vedic and later, an aspirate mute is not seldom found written double\u2014especially, if it be one of rare occurrence: for example (RV.), akhkhal\u012b, j\u00e1jhjhat\u012b.\n\n155. In a few roots, when a final sonant aspirate (\u0918\u094d gh, \u0927\u094d dh, \u092d\u094d bh; also \u0939\u094d h, as representing an original \u0918\u094d gh) thus loses its aspiration, the initial sonant consonant (\u0917\u094d g or \u0926\u094d d or \u092c\u094d b) becomes aspirate.\n\na. That is to say, the original initial aspirate of such roots is restored, when its presence does not interfere with the euphonic law, of comparatively recent origin, which (in Sanskrit and Greek) forbids a root to both begin and end with an aspirate.\n\nb. The roots which allow this peculiar change are:\n\nin gh\u2014dagh;\n\nin h (for original gh)\u2014dah, dih, duh, druh, d\u1e5b\u1e45h, guh; and also grah (in the later desiderative jigh\u1e5bk\u1e63a);\n\nin dh\u2014bandh, b\u0101dh, budh;\n\nin bh\u2014dabh (but only in the later desiderative dhipsa, for which the older language has dipsa).<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235446":{"pageid":235446,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/82","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>c. The same change appears when the law as to finals causes the loss of the aspiration at the end of the root: see above, 141.</p>\n\nd. But from dah, duh, druh, and guh are found in the Veda also forms without the restored initial aspirate: thus, dak\u1e63at; aduk\u1e63at; duduk\u1e63a etc.; juguk\u1e63a; mitradr\u00fak.\n\ne. The same analogy is followed by dadh, the abbreviated substitute of the present-stems dadh\u0101, from \u221adh\u0101 (667), in some of the forms of conjugation: thus, dhatthas from dadh + thas, adhatta from adadh + ta, adhaddhvam from adadh + dhvam, etc.\n\nf. No case is met with of the throwing back of an aspiration upon combination with the 2d sing. impv. act. ending dhi: thus, dugdhi, daddhi (RV.), but dhugdhvam, dhaddhvam.\n\n<center>Surd and Sonant Assimilation.</center>\n\n156. Under this head, there is especially one very marked and important difference between the internal combinations of a root or stem with suffixes and endings, and the external combinations of stem with stem in composition and of word with word in sentence-making: namely\u2014\n\n157. a. In internal combination, the initial vowel or semivowel or nasal of an ending of inflection or derivation exercises no altering influence upon a final consonant of the root or stem to which it is added.\n\nb. To this rule there are some exceptions: thus, some of the derivatives noted at 111 d; final d of a root before the participial suffix na (957 d); and the forms noted below, 161 b.\n\nc. In external combination, on the other hand, an initial sonant of whatever class, even a vowel or semivowel or nasal, requires the conversion of a final surd to sonant.\n\nd. It has been pointed out above (152) that in the rules of external combination only admitted finals, along with s and r, need to be taken account of, all others being regarded as reduced to these before combining with initials.\n\n158. Final vowels, nasals, and \u0932\u094d l are nowhere liable to change in the processes of surd and sonant assimilation.\n\na. The r, however, has a corresponding surd in s, to which it is sometimes changed in external combination, under circumstances that favor a surd utterance (178).<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235447":{"pageid":235447,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/83","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>159. With the exceptions above stated, the collision of surd and sonant sounds is avoided in combinations\u2014and, regularly and usually, by assimilating the final to the following initial, or by regressive assimilation.</p>\n\nThus, in internal combination: \u00e1tsi, \u00e1tti, atth\u00e1s, att\u00e1 (\u221aad + si etc.); \u00e7agdh\u00ed, \u00e7agdhv\u00e1m (\u221a\u00e7ak + dhi etc.);\u2014in external combination, \u00e1bh\u016bd ay\u00e1m, jy\u00f3g j\u012bva, \u1e63\u00e1\u1e0d a\u00e7\u012bt\u00e1ya\u1e25, tri\u1e63\u1e6d\u00fab \u00e1pi, dig-gaja, \u1e63a\u1e0d-ah\u00e1, arc\u00e1d-dh\u016bma, b\u1e5bh\u00e1d-bh\u0101nu, ab-j\u00e1.\n\n160. If, however, a final sonant aspirate of a root is followed by \u0924\u094d t or \u0925\u094d th of an ending, the assimilation is in the other direction, or progressive: the combination is made sonant, and the aspiration of the final (lost according to 153, above) is transferred to the initial of the ending.\n\nThus, gh with t or th becomes gdh; dh with the same becomes ddh, as buddh\u00e1 (\u221abudh + ta), runddh\u00e1s (\u221arundh + thas or tas); bh with the same becomes bdh, as labdh\u00e1 (\u221alabh + ta), labdhv\u0101\u0301 (\u221alabh + tv\u0101).\n\na. Moreover, h, as representing original gh, is treated in the same manner: thus, dugdh\u00e1, d\u00f3gdhum from duh\u2014and compare r\u016b\u1e0dh\u00e1 and l\u012b\u1e0dh\u00e1 from ruh and lih, etc., 222 b.\n\nb. In this combination, as the sonant aspiration is not lost but transferred, the restoration of the initial aspiration (155) does not take place.\n\nc. In dadh from \u221adh\u0101 (155 e), the more normal method is followed; the dh is made surd, and the initial aspirated: thus, dhatthas, dhattas. And RV. has dhaktam instead of dagdham from \u221adagh; and TA. has intt\u0101m instead of inddh\u0101m from \u221aidh.\n\n161. Before a nasal in external combination, a final mute may be simply made sonant, or it may be still further assimilated, being changed to the nasal of its own class.\n\nThus, either t\u00e1d n\u00e1mas or t\u00e1n n\u00e1mas, v\u0101\u0301g me or v\u0101\u0301n\u0304 me, b\u00e1\u1e0d mah\u0101\u0301n or b\u00e1\u1e47 mah\u0101\u0301n, tri\u1e63\u1e6d\u00fab n\u016bn\u00e1m or tri\u1e63\u1e6d\u00fam n\u016bn\u00e1m.\n\na. In practice, the conversion into a nasal is almost invariably made in the manuscripts, as, indeed, it is by the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas required and not permitted merely. Even by the general grammarians it is required in the compound \u1e63\u00e1\u1e47\u1e47avati, and before m\u0101tr\u0101, and the suffix maya (1225): thus, v\u0101n\u0304m\u00e1ya, m\u1e5bnm\u00e1ya.\n\nb. Even in internal combination, the same assimilation is made in some of the derivatives noted in 111 d, and in the na-participles (957 d).

Before l, a final t is not merely made sonant, but fully assimilated, becoming l: thus, t\u00e1l labhate, \u00falluptam.\n\n163. Before \u0939\u094d h (the case occurs only in external combination), a final mute is made sonant; and then the \u0939\u094d h may either remain unchanged or be converted into the sonant aspirate corresponding with the former: thus, either \u0924\u0926\u094d\u0939\u093f t\u00e1d h\u00ed or \u0924\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f t\u00e1d dh\u00ed.\n\na. In practice, the latter method is almost invariably followed; and the grammarians of the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khya period are nearly unanimous in requiring it. The phonetic difference between the two is very slight.\n\nExamples are: v\u0101\u0301g ghut\u00e1\u1e25, \u1e63\u00e1\u1e0d\u1e0dhot\u0101 (\u1e63a\u1e6d + hot\u0101), taddhita (tat + hita), anu\u1e63\u1e6d\u00fab bh\u00ed.\n\n<center>Combinations of final \u0938\u094d s and \u0930\u094d r.</center>\n\n164. The euphonic changes of \u0938\u094d s and \u0930\u094d r are best considered together, because of the practical relation of the two sounds, in composition and sentence-collocation, as corresponding surd and sonant: in a host of cases \u0938\u094d s becomes \u0930\u094d r in situations requiring or favoring the occurrence of a sonant; and, much less often, \u0930\u094d r becomes \u0938\u094d s where a surd is required.\n\na. In internal combination, the two are far less exchangeable with one another: and this class of cases may best be taken up first.\n\n165. Final r radical or quasi-radical (that is, not belonging to an ending of derivation) remains unchanged before both surd and sonant sounds, and even before su in declension: thus, p\u00edpar\u1e63i, caturth\u00e1, cat\u00far\u1e63u, p\u016br\u1e63\u00fa.\n\n166. Final radical s remains before a surd in general, and usually before s, as in \u00e7\u0101\u0301ssi, \u00e7\u0101ssva, \u0101sse, \u0101\u00e7\u012b\u0301\u1e63\u1e63u (the last is also written \u0101\u00e7\u012b\u0301\u1e25\u1e63u: 172): but it is lost in \u00e1si (\u221aas + si: 636). Before a sonant (that is, bh) in declension, it is treated as in external combination: thus, \u0101\u00e7\u012b\u0301rbhis. Before a sonant (that is, dh) in conjugation, it appears to be dropped, at least after long \u0101: thus, \u00e7\u0101dhi, \u00e7a\u00e7\u0101dhi, cak\u0101dhi (the only quotable cases); in edh\u00ed (\u221aas + dhi: 636) the root syllable is irregularly altered; but in 2d perss. pl., made with dhvam, as \u0101dhvam, \u00e7\u0101dhvam, ar\u0101dhvam (881 a), vadhvam (\u221avas<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235449":{"pageid":235449,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/85","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><noinclude>57<center>{{sc|Final S and T.}}</center><div align=\"right\">[-169</div></noinclude>\n\n''clothe''), it is, on account of the equivalence and interchangeability of dhv and ddvh (232), impossible to say whether the s in omitted or converted into d.\n\na. Final radical s is very rare; RV. (twice, both 2d pers. sing.) treats \u00e1ghas from \u221aghas in the same manner as any ordinary word ending in as.\n\nb. For certain cases of irregular loss of the s of a root or tense-stem, see 233 b\u2013e.\n\n167. In a few very rare cases, final radical s before s is changed to t (perhaps by dissimilation): they are, from \u221avas ''dwell'' (also sporadically from vas ''shine'', \u00c7B., and vas ''clothe'', Har.), the future vatsy\u0101\u0301mi and aorist \u00e1v\u0101tsam; from \u221aghas, the desiderative stem j\u00edghatsa.\n\na. For t as apparent ending of the 3d sing. in s-verbs, see 555 a.\n\n168. According to the grammarians, the final s of certain other roots, used as noun-stems, becomes t at the end of the word, and before bh and su: thus, dhvat, dhvadbhis, sradbhyas, sratsu. But genuine examples of such change are not quotable.\n\na. Sporadic cases of a like convention are found in the Veda: namely, m\u0101dbh\u00eds and m\u0101dbhy\u00e1s from m\u0101\u0301s: u\u1e63\u00e1dbhis from u\u1e63\u00e1s; sv\u00e1tavadbhyas from sv\u00e1tavas; sv\u00e1vadbhis etc. (not quotable) from sv\u00e1vas. But the actuality of the conversion here is open to grave doubt; it rather seems the substitution of a t-stem for an s-stem. The same is true of the change of v\u0101\u1e45s to vat in the declension of perfect participles (458). The stem ana\u1e0dvah (404), from anas-vah, is anomalous and isolated.\n\nb. In the compound ducch\u00fan\u0101 (dus-\u00e7un\u0101) and p\u00e1rucchepa (parus-\u00e7epa), the final s of the first member is treated as if a t (203).\n\n169. As the final consonant of derivative stems and of inflected forms, both of declension and of conjugation, s is extremely frequent; and its changes form a subject of first-rate importance in Sanskrit euphony. The r, on the other hand, is quite rare.\n\na. The r is found as original final in certain case-forms of stems in \u1e5b or ar (369 ff.); in root-stems in ir and ur from roots in \u1e5b (383 b); in a small number of other stems, as sv\u00e0r, \u00e1har and \u016b\u0301dhar (beside \u00e1han and \u016b\u0301dhan: 430), dv\u0101\u0301r or dur, and the Vedic v\u00e1dhar, u\u1e63arvasar-, vanar-, \u00e7rutar-, sapar-, sabar-, athar- (cf. 176 c); in a few particles, as ant\u00e1r, pr\u0101t\u00e1r, p\u00fanar; and in the numeral cat\u00far (482 g).\n\nb. The euphonic treatment of s and r yielding precisely the same result after all vowels except a and \u0101, there are certain forms with regard to which it is uncertain whether they end in s or r, and opinions differ respecting them. Such are ur (or us) of the gen.-abl. sing. of \u1e5b-stems (371 c), and us (or ur) of the 3d plur. of verbs (550 c).<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235450":{"pageid":235450,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/86","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>170. a.

In the Veda, the retention of the sibilant in compounds is the general rule, the exceptions to which are detailed in the Vedic grammars.\n\nb. In the later language, the retention is mainly determined by the intimacy or the antiquity and frequency of the combination. Thus, the final sibilant of a preposition or a word fitting the office of a preposition before a verbal root is wont to be preserved; and that of a stem before a derivative of \u221ak\u1e5b, before pati, before kalpa and k\u0101ma, and so on. Examples are namask\u0101ra, v\u0101caspati, \u0101yu\u1e63k\u0101ma, payaskalpa.\n\nc. The Vedic retention of the sibilant in sentence-collocation is detailed in full in the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas. The chief classes of cases are: 1. the final of a preposition or its like before a verbal form; 2. of a genitive before a governing noun: as div\u00e1s putr\u00e1\u1e25, i\u1e0d\u00e1s pad\u00e9; 3. of an ablative before p\u00e1ri: as him\u00e1vatas p\u00e1ri; 4. of other less classifiable cases: as dy\u0101\u00fa\u1e63 pit\u0101\u0301, tr\u00ed\u1e63 p\u016btv\u0101\u0301, y\u00e1s p\u00e1ti\u1e25, paridh\u00ed\u1e63 p\u00e1t\u0101ti, etc.\n\n172.

There are one or two exceptions to these rules:\n\na. If the initial sibilant has a surd mute after it, the final s may be dropped altogether\u2014and by some authorities is required to be so dropped. Thus, v\u0101yava stha or v\u0101yava\u1e25 stha; catustan\u0101m or catu\u1e25stan\u0101m. With regard to this point the usage of the different manuscripts and editions is greatly at variance.\n\nb. Before ts, the s is allowed to become visarga, instead of being retained.\n\n174. Before a sonant, either vowel or consonant (except \u0930\u094d r: see 179), \u0938\u094d s is changed to the sonant \u0930\u094d r\u2014unless, indeed, it be preceded by \u0905 a or \u0906 \u0101.\n\nExamples are: devapatir iva, \u00e7r\u012br iva; manur gacchati, tan\u016br apsu; svas\u1e5dr ajanayat; tayor ad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dak\u0101ma\u1e25; sarv\u0101ir gu\u1e47\u0101i\u1e25; agner manve.\n\na. For a few cases like d\u016b\u1e0d\u0101\u00e7a, d\u016b\u1e47\u0101\u00e7a, see below, 199d.\n\nb. The exclamation bhos (456) loses its s before vowels and sonant consonants: thus, bho n\u0101i\u1e63adha (and the s is sometimes found omitted also before surds).\n\nc. The endings \u0905\u0938\u094d as and \u0906\u0938\u094d \u0101s (both of which are extremely common) follow rules of their own, namely:\n\n175. a. Final \u0905\u0938\u094d as, before any sonant consonant and before short \u0905 a, is changed to \u0913 o\u2014and the \u0905 a after it is lost.\n\nb. The resulting accentuation, and the fact that the loss of a is only occasional in the older language of the Veda, have been pointed out above, 135a, c.\n\nExamples are: nalo n\u0101ma, brahma\u1e47yo vedavit; manobhava; hantavyo \u2018smi; anyonya (anyas + anya), ya\u00e7ortham (ya\u00e7as + artham).\n\nc. Final \u0905\u0938\u094d as before any other vowel than \u0905 a loses its \u0938\u094d s, becoming simple \u0905 a; and the hiatus thus occasioned remains.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235452":{"pageid":235452,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/88","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>d.

Exceptions to the rules as to final as are:\n\na. The nominative masculine pronouns s\u00e1s and e\u1e63\u00e1s and (Vedic) sy\u00e1s (495 a, 499 a, b) lose their s before any consonant: thus, sa dadar\u00e7a ''he saw'', e\u1e63a puru\u1e63a\u1e25 ''this man''; but so \u2018brav\u012bt ''he said'', puru\u1e63a\u1e25 e\u1e63a\u1e25.\n\nb. Instances are met with, both in the earlier and in the later language, of effacement of the hiatus after alteration of as, by combination of the remaining final a with the following initial vowel: thus, tato \u2019v\u0101ca (tatas + uv\u0101ca), payo\u1e63\u1e47\u012b (payas + u\u1e63\u1e47\u012b), adh\u0101sana (adhas + \u0101sana): compare 133 c, 177 b. In the Veda, such a combination is sometimes shown by the metre to be required, though the written text has the hiatus. But sa in RV. is in the great majority of cases combined with the following vowel: e.g. s\u00e9 \u2019d for s\u00e1 \u00edd, s\u0101\u0301 \u2019sm\u0101i for s\u00e1 asm\u0101i, s\u0101\u00fa \u2019\u1e63adh\u012b\u1e25 for s\u00e1 \u00f3\u1e63adh\u012b\u1e25; and similar examples are found also in the other Vedic texts.\n\nc. Other sporadic irregularities in the treatment of final as occur. Thus, it is changed to ar instead of o once in RV. in av\u00e1s, once in SV. in \u00e1vas (RV. \u00e1vo), once in MS. in dambhi\u1e63as; in bhuvas (second of the trio of sacred utterances bh\u016bs, bhuvas, svar), except in its earliest occurrences; in a series of words in a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a passage (TS. K.), viz. jinv\u00e1r, ugr\u00e1r, bh\u012bm\u00e1r, tve\u1e63\u00e1r, \u00e7rut\u00e1r, bh\u016bt\u00e1r, and (K. only) p\u016bt\u00e1r; in janar and mahar; and some of the ar-stems noted at 169 a are perhaps of kindred character. On the other hand, as is several times changed to o in RV. before a surd consonant; and s\u00e1s twice, and y\u00e1s once, retains its final sibilant in a like position.\n\nd. In MS., the final a left before hiatus by alteration of either as (o) or e (133) is made long if itself unaccented and if the following initial vowel is accented: thus, s\u016b\u0301r\u0101 \u00e9ti (from s\u016b\u0301ras + \u00e9ti), nirupy\u00e1t\u0101 \u00edndr\u0101ya (from -y\u00e1te + \u00ednd-), and also k\u0101ry\u0101\u0300 \u00e9ka- (from k\u0101ry\u00e0s, because virtually k\u0101r\u00edas); but \u0101dity\u00e1 \u00edndra\u1e25 (from \u0101dity\u00e1s + \u00edndra\u1e25), et\u00e1 \u00edtare (from et\u00e9 + \u00edtare).\n\n177. Final \u0906\u0938\u094d \u0101s before any sonant, whether vowel or consonant, loses its \u0938\u094d s, becoming simple \u0906 \u0101; and a hiatus thus occasioned remains.\n\na. The maintenance of the hiatus in these cases, as in that of o and e and \u0101i (above, 133\u20134), seems to indicate a recent loss of the intermediate sound. Opinions are divided as to what this should have been. Some of the native grammarians assimilate the case of \u0101s to that of \u0101i,<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235453":{"pageid":235453,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/89","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n{{rh|61|Combinations of Final r.|[-180}}\n\n\n</noinclude>assuming the conversion of \u0101y in both alike\u2014but probably only as a matter of formal convenience in rule-making.\n\nb. Here, too (as in the similar cases of e and \u0101i and o: 133 c, 176b), there are examples to be found, both earlier and later, of effacement of the hiatus.\n\n178. Final \u0930\u094d r, in general, shows the same form which \u0938\u094d s would show under the same conditions.\n\na. Thus, it becomes visarga when final, and a sibilant or visarga before an initial surd mute or sibilant (170): thus, rudat\u012b puna\u1e25, dv\u0101s tat, sv\u00e0\u00e7 ca, cat\u00fa\u00e7catv\u0101ri\u1e45\u00e7at; and (111c, d) pr\u0101tast\u00e1na, antastya, catu\u1e63\u1e6daya, dh\u016bstva; pr\u0101ta\u1e25 karoti, anta\u1e25p\u0101ta.\n\nb. But original final r preceded by a or \u0101 maintains itself unchanged before a sonant: thus, punar eti, pr\u0101tarjit, \u00e1kar jy\u00f3ti\u1e25, \u00e1h\u0101r d\u0101\u0301mn\u0101, v\u0101rdhi.\n\nc. The r is preserved unchanged even before a surd in a number of Vedic compounds: thus, aharp\u00e1ti; sv\u00e0rcanas, sv\u00e0rcak\u1e63as, sv\u00e0rpati, svar\u1e63\u0101\u0301, sv\u00e0r\u1e63\u0101ti; dh\u016br\u1e63\u00e1d, dh\u016br\u1e63ah; p\u016b\u0301rpati, v\u0101rk\u0101ry\u00e1, \u0101\u00e7\u012b\u0301rpada, punartta; and in some of these the r is optionally retained in the later language. The RV. also has \u0101var t\u00e1ma\u1e25 once in sentence-combination.\n\nd. On the other hand, final ar of the verb-form \u0101var is changed to o before a sonant in several cases in RV. And r is lost, like s, in one or two cases in the same text: thus, ak\u1e63\u0101 \u00edndu\u1e25, \u00e1ha ev\u00e1.\n\n179. A double r is nowhere admitted: if such would occur, either by retention of an original r or by conversion of s to r, one r is omitted, and the preceding vowel, if short, is made long by compensation.\n\nThus, pun\u0101 ramate, n\u1e5bpat\u012b r\u0101jati, m\u0101t\u016b\u0301 rih\u00e1n, jyot\u012bratha, d\u016broha\u1e47\u00e1.\n\na. In some Vedic texts, however, there are instances of ar changed to o before initial r: thus, sv\u00f2 roh\u0101va.\n\n<center>Conversion of \u0938\u094d s to \u0937\u094d \u1e63.</center>\n\n180. The dental sibilant \u0938\u094d s is changed to the lingual \u0937\u094d \u1e63, if immediately preceded by any vowel save \u0905 a and \u0906 \u0101, or by \u0915\u094d k or \u0930\u094d r\u2014unless the \u0938\u094d s be final, or followed by \u0930\u094d r.\n\na.

The general Hindu grammar prescribes the same change after a l also; but the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas give no such rule, and phonetic considerations, the l being a dental sound, are absolutely against it. Actual cases of the combination do not occur in the older language, nor have any been pointed out in the later.\n\nc. The vowels that cause the alteration of s to \u1e63 may be called for brevity\u2019s sake \u201calterant\u201d vowels.\n\n181. Hence, in the interior of a Sanskrit word, the dental s is not usually found after any vowel save a and \u0101, but, instead of it the lingual \u1e63. But\u2014\n\na. A following r prevents the conversion: thus, usra, tiaras, tamisra. And it is but seldom made in the forms and derivatives of a root containing an ''r''-element (whether r or \u1e5b), whatever the position of that element: thus, sisarti, sis\u1e5btam, sar\u012bs\u1e5bp\u00e1, tistire, parisr\u00fat. To this rule there are a few exceptions, as vi\u1e63\u1e6d\u00edr, vi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101r\u00e1, n\u00ed\u1e63\u1e6d\u1e5bta, v\u00ed\u1e63pardhas, g\u00e1vi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, etc. In aju\u1e63ran the final \u1e63 of a root is preserved even immediately before r.\n\nb. This dissimilating influence of a following r, as compared with the invariable assimilating influence of a preceding r, is peculiar and problematic.\n\nc. The recurrence of \u1e63 in successive syllables is sometimes avoided by leaving the former s unchanged: thus, sisak\u1e63i, but si\u1e63akti; y\u0101sis\u012b\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101s, but y\u0101si\u1e63\u012bmahi. Similarly, in certain desiderative formations: see below, 184e.\n\nd. Other cases are sporadic: RV. has the forms sisice and sisicus (but si\u1e63icatus), and the stems \u1e5bb\u012b\u0301sa, k\u012bst\u00e1, b\u00edsa, bus\u00e1, b\u1e5b\u0301saya; a single root pis, with its derivative pesuka, is found once in \u00c7B.; MS. has m\u1e5bsm\u1e5b\u1e63\u0101\u0301; m\u00fasala begins to be found in AV.; and such cases grow more numerous; for pu\u1e41s and the roots ni\u1e45s and hi\u1e45s, see below, 183a.\n\n182. On the other hand (as was pointed out above, 62), the occurrence of \u1e63 in Sanskrit words is nearly limited to cases falling under this rule: others are rather sporadic anomalies\u2014except where \u1e63 is the product of \u00e7 or k\u1e63 before a dental, as in dra\u1e63\u1e6dum, ca\u1e63\u1e6de, tva\u1e63\u1e6dar: see 218, 221. Thus, we find\u2014\n\na. Four roots, ka\u1e63, la\u1e63, bha\u1e63, bh\u0101\u1e63, of which the last is common and is found as early as the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as.\n\nb. Further, in RV., \u00e1\u1e63a, kav\u00e1\u1e63a, ca\u1e63\u0101\u0301la, c\u0101\u0301\u1e63a, j\u00e1l\u0101\u1e63a, p\u0101\u1e63y\u00e0, ba\u1e63k\u00e1ya, v\u00e1\u1e63a\u1e6d (for vak\u1e63at?), k\u0101\u0301\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101; and, by anomalous alteration of original s, -\u1e63\u0101h (tur\u0101\u1e63\u0101\u0301h etc.), \u00e1\u1e63\u0101\u1e0dha, upa\u1e63\u1e6d\u00fat, and probably ap\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dh\u00e1 and a\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012bv\u00e1nt. Such cases grow more common later.\n\nc.

And the alteration takes place in the initial s of an ending after the final s of a stem, whether the latter be regarded as also changed to \u1e63 or as converted into visarga: thus, havi\u1e63\u1e63u or havi\u1e25\u1e63u, paru\u1e63\u1e63u or paru\u1e25\u1e63u.</p>\n\na.

The principle cases of alteration of s in internal combination are these:\n\na. In endings, inflectional or derivative, beginning with s\u2014thus, su; si, se, sva; s of sibilant-aorist, future, and desiderative; suffixes sna, snu, sya, etc.\u2014after a final alterant vowel or consonant of root or stem, or a union-vowel: thus, juho\u1e63i, \u00e7e\u1e63e, an\u0101i\u1e63am, bhavi\u1e63y\u0101mi, \u00e7u\u00e7r\u016b\u1e63e, de\u1e63\u1e47a, ji\u1e63\u1e47u, vik\u1e63u, ak\u0101r\u1e63am.\n\nb. The final s of a stem before an ending or suffix: thus: havi\u1e63\u0101, havi\u1e63as, etc., from havis; \u00e7ak\u1e63u\u1e63mant, \u00e7oci\u1e63ka, m\u0101nu\u1e63a, manu\u1e63ya, jyoti\u1e63\u1e6dva.\n\nc. Roots having a final sibilant (except \u00e7) after an alterant vowel are\u2014with the exception of fictitious ones and pis, ni\u1e45s, hi\u1e45s\u2014regarded as ending in \u1e63, not s; and concerning the treatment of this \u1e63 in combination, see below, 225\u20136.\n\nd. The initial s of a root after a reduplication: thus, si\u1e63yade, su\u1e63v\u0101pa, s\u012b\u1e63\u0101sati, co\u1e63k\u016byate, sani\u1e63va\u1e47at.\n\ne. Excepted is in general an initial radical s in a desiderative stem, when the desiderative-sign becomes \u1e63: thus, sis\u012br\u1e63ati from \u221as\u1e5b, sisan\u0304k\u1e63ati from \u221asa\u00f1j. And there are other scattering cases, as tresus (perf. from \u221atras), etc.\n\n185. But the same change occurs also, on a considerable scale, in external combination, especially in composition. Thus:\n\na. Both in verbal forms and in derivatives, the final i or u of a preposition or other like prefix ordinarily lingualizes the initial s of the root to which it is prefixed; since such combinations are both of great frequency and of peculiar intimacy, analogous with those of root or stem and affix: thus, abhi\u1e63\u0101\u0301c, prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101\u0301, n\u00ed\u1e63ikta, v\u00ed\u1e63ita; anu\u1e63vadh\u00e1m, su\u1e63\u00e9ka; the cases are numberless.\n\nb. The principle exceptions are in accordance with the principles already laid down: namely, when the root contains an ''r''-element, and when a recurrence of the sibilant would take place. But there are also others, of a more irregular character; and the complete account of the treatment of initial radical s after a prefix would be matter of great detail, and not worth giving here.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235456":{"pageid":235456,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/92","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>c.

Much more anomalous is the occasional alteration of initial radical s after an a-element of a prefix. Such cases are ava \u1e63\u1e6dambh (against ni stambh and prati stambh) and (according to the grammarians) ava \u1e63van.\n\n186. In other compounds, the final alterant vowel of the first member not infrequently (especially in the Veda) lingualizes the initial s of the second: for example, yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, pit\u1e5b\u1e63vas\u1e5b, go\u1e63\u1e6dh\u00e1, agni\u1e63\u1e6dom\u00e1, anu\u1e63\u1e6d\u00fabh, tr\u00ed\u1e63a\u1e41dhi, divi\u1e63\u00e1d, parame\u1e63\u1e6dh\u00edn, abhi\u1e63en\u00e1, pit\u1e5b\u1e63\u00e1d, puru\u1e63\u1e6dut\u00e1.\n\na. A very few cases occur of the same alteration after an a-element: thus, sa\u1e63t\u00fabh, ava\u1e63\u1e6dambha, savya\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101\u0301, ap\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101\u0301, upa\u1e63\u1e6d\u00fat; also \u221asah, when its final, by 147, becomes \u1e6d: thus, satr\u0101\u1e63\u0101\u0301\u1e6d (but satr\u0101s\u0101\u0301ham).\n\n187. The final s of the first member of a compound often becomes \u1e63 after an alterant vowel: thus, the s of a prepositional prefix, as ni\u1e63\u1e63\u00eddhvan, du\u1e63\u1e6d\u00e1ra (for du\u1e63\u1e63t\u00e1ra), \u0101v\u00ed\u1e63k\u1e5bta; and, regularly, a s retained instead of being converted to visarga before a labial or guttural mute (171 a), as havi\u1e63p\u0101\u0301, jyoti\u1e63k\u1e5b\u0301t; tapu\u1e63p\u0101\u0301.\n\n188. Once more, in the Veda, the same alteration, both of an initial and of a final s, is not infrequent even between the words composing a sentence. The cases are detailed in the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khya belonging to each text, and are of very various character. Thus:\n\na. The initial s, especially of particles; as \u016b \u1e63\u00fa, h\u00ed \u1e63ma, k\u00e1m u \u1e63v\u00edt;\u2014also of pronouns: as h\u00ed \u1e63\u00e1\u1e25;\u2014of verb-forms, especially from \u221aas: as h\u00ed \u1e63\u1e6dh\u00e1, div\u00ed \u1e63\u1e6dha;\u2014and in other scattering cases: as u \u1e63\u1e6duhi, n\u016b\u0301 \u1e63\u1e6dhir\u00e1m, tr\u012b\u0301 \u1e63adh\u00e1sth\u0101, \u00e1dhi \u1e63\u1e47\u00f3\u1e25, n\u00e1ki\u1e25 \u1e63\u00e1\u1e25, y\u00e1ju\u1e25 \u1e63kann\u00e1m, agn\u00ed\u1e25 \u1e63\u1e6dave.\n\nb. A final s, oftenest before pronouns (especially toneless ones): as agn\u00ed\u1e63 \u1e6dv\u0101, n\u00ed\u1e63 \u1e6de, \u012by\u00fa\u1e63 \u1e6d\u00e9, \u00e7\u00faci\u1e63 \u1e6dv\u00e1m, s\u00e1dhi\u1e63 \u1e6d\u00e1va;\u2014but also in other cases, and wherever a final s is preserved, instead of being turned into visarga, before a guttural or labial (171): as tr\u00ed\u1e63 p\u016btv\u0101\u0301, \u0101\u0301yu\u1e63 k\u1e5b\u1e47otu, v\u0101\u0301sto\u1e63 p\u00e1ti\u1e25, dy\u0101\u00fa\u1e63 pit\u0101\u0301, v\u00edbhi\u1e63 p\u00e1t\u0101t.\n\n<center>Conversion of \u0928\u094d n to \u0923\u094d \u1e47.</center>\n\n189.

We may thus figure to ourselves the ''rationale'' of the process: in the marked proclivity of the language toward lingual utterance, especially of the nasal, the tip of the tongue, when once reverted into the loose lingual position by the utterance of a non-contact lingual element, tends to hang there and make its next nasal contact in that position; and does so, unless the proclivity is satisfied by the utterance of a lingual mute, or the organ is thrown out of adjustment by the utterance of an element which causes it to assume a different posture. This is not the case with the gutturals or labials, which do not move the front part of the tongue (and, as the influence of k on following s shows, the guttural position favors the succession of a lingual): and the y is too weakly palatal to interfere with the alteration (as its next relative, the i-vowel, itself lingualizes a s).\n\nb. This is a rule of constant application; and (as was pointed out above, 46) the great majority of occurrences of \u1e47 in the language are a result of it.\n\n190. The rule has force especially\u2014\n\na. When suffixes, of influence or derivation, are added to roots or stems containing one of the altering sounds; thus, rudr\u00e9\u1e47a, rudr\u0101\u0301\u1e47\u0101m, v\u0101\u0301ri\u1e47e, v\u0101\u0301ri\u1e47\u012b, v\u0101\u0301r\u012b\u1e47i, d\u0101t\u1e5d\u0301\u1e47i, h\u00e1r\u0101\u1e47i, dv\u00e9\u1e63\u0101\u1e47i, kr\u012b\u1e47\u0101\u0301mi, \u00e7\u1e5b\u1e47\u00f3ti, k\u1e63ubh\u0101\u1e47\u00e1, gh\u1e5b\u1e47\u00e1, k\u00e1r\u1e47a, v\u1e5bk\u1e47\u00e1, rug\u1e47\u00e1, dr\u00e1vi\u1e47a, i\u1e63\u00e1\u1e47i, pur\u0101\u1e47\u00e1, r\u00e9k\u1e47as, c\u00e1k\u1e63a\u1e47a, c\u00edk\u012br\u1e63am\u0101\u1e47a, k\u1e5b\u0301pam\u0101\u1e47a.\n\nb. When the final n of a root or stem comes to be followed, in inflection or derivation, by such sounds as allow it to feel the effect of a preceding altering cause: thus, from \u221aran, r\u00e1\u1e47anti, r\u00e1\u1e47yati, r\u0101ra\u1e47a, ar\u0101\u1e47i\u1e63us; from brahman, br\u00e1hma\u1e47\u0101, br\u00e1hm\u0101\u1e47i, br\u0101hma\u1e47\u00e1, brahma\u1e47y\u00e0, br\u00e1hma\u1e47vant.\n\nc. The form pi\u1e47ak (RV.: 2d and 3d sing. impf.), from \u221api\u1e63, is wholly anomalous.\n\n191. This rule (like that for the change of s to \u1e63) applies strictly and especially when the nasal and the cause of its alteration both lie within the limits of the same integral word; but (also like the other) it is extended, within certain limits, to compound words\u2014and even, in the Veda, to contiguous words in the sentence.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235458":{"pageid":235458,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/94","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>192. Especially, a preposition or similar prefix to a root, if it contain r or end in euphonic r for s (174), very often lingualizes the n of a root or of its derived stems and forms. Thus:</p>\n\na. The initial n of a root is usually and regularly so altered, in all forms and derivatives, after par\u0101, pari, pra, nir (for nis), antar, dur (for dus): thus, p\u00e1r\u0101 \u1e47aya, p\u00e1ri \u1e47\u012byate, pr\u00e1 \u1e47udasva; par\u0101\u1e47utti, pari\u1e47\u0101ma, pra\u1e47av\u00e1, nir\u1e47\u00edj, dur\u1e47\u00e1\u00e7a. Roots suffering this change are written with initial \u1e47 in the native root-lists. The only exceptions of importance are n\u1e5bt, nabh, nand, and na\u00e7 when its \u00e7 becomes \u1e63 (as in pr\u00e1na\u1e63\u1e6da).\n\nb. The final n of a root is lingualized in some of the forms of an and han: thus, pr\u0101\u0301 \u2019\u1e47iti, pr\u0101\u1e47\u00e1, pr\u00e1 ha\u1e47yate, prah\u00e1\u1e47ana.\n\nc. The class-signs nu and n\u0101 are altered after the roots hi and m\u012b\u0301: thus, p\u00e1ri hi\u1e47omi, pr\u00e1 mi\u1e47anti (but the latter not in the Veda).\n\nd. The 1st sing. impv. ending \u0101ni is sometimes altered: thus, pr\u00e1 bhav\u0101\u1e47i.\n\ne. Derivatives by suffixes containing n sometimes have \u1e47 by influence of a preposition: thus, pray\u0101\u0301\u1e47a.\n\nf. The n of the preposition ni is sometimes altered, like the initial of a root, after another preposition: thus, pra\u1e47ip\u0101ta, pra\u1e47idhi.\n\n193. In compound words, an altering cause in one member sometimes lingualizes a n of the next following member\u2014either its initial or final n, or n in its inflectional or derivative ending. The exercise of the altering influence can be seen to depend in part upon the closeness or frequency of the compound, or its integration by being made the base of a derivative. Examples are: gr\u0101ma\u1e47\u012b\u0301, tri\u1e47\u0101man, ur\u016b\u1e47as\u00e1; v\u1e5btrah\u00e1\u1e47am etc. (but v\u1e5btraghn\u0101\u0301 etc.: 195 a), n\u1e5bm\u00e1\u1e47as, drugha\u1e47\u00e1; prav\u0101\u0301ha\u1e47a, n\u1e5bp\u0101\u0301\u1e47a, p\u016bry\u0101\u0301\u1e47a, pit\u1e5by\u0101\u0301\u1e47a; svarg\u00e9\u1e47a, durg\u0101\u0301\u1e47i, usr\u00e1y\u0101m\u1e47e, tryan\u0304g\u0101\u0301\u1e47\u0101m.\n\n194. Finally, in the Veda, a n (usually initial) is occasionally lingualized even by an altering sound in another word. The toneless pronouns nas and ena- are oftenest thus affected: thus, p\u00e1ri \u1e47as, pr\u0101\u00ed \u2019\u1e47\u0101n, \u00edndra e\u1e47am; but also of the particle n\u00e1 ''like'': thus, v\u0101\u0301r \u1e47\u00e1; and a few other cases, as v\u00e1r \u1e47\u0101\u0301ma, p\u00fanar \u1e47ay\u0101masi, agn\u00e9r \u00e1ve\u1e47a. More anomalous, and perhaps to be rejected as false readings, are such as tr\u012b\u0301\u1e47 im\u0101\u0301n and ak\u1e63\u0101\u0301\u1e47 \u00e1va and suh\u0101\u0301r\u1e47 \u1e47a\u1e25 (MS.), and vy\u1e5b\u1e63a\u1e47 v\u0101 (\u0100past.).\n\n195. a. The immediate combination of a n with a preceding guttural or labial seems in some cases to hinder the conversion to \u1e47: thus, v\u1e5btraghn\u0101\u0301 etc., k\u1e63ubhn\u0101ti, t\u1e5bpnoti (but in Veda t\u1e5bp\u1e47u), k\u1e63epn\u00fa, su\u1e63umn\u00e1.\n\nb. The RV. has the exceptions \u00fa\u1e63\u1e6dr\u0101n\u0101m and r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dr\u0101\u0301n\u0101m.\n\n<center>Conversion of dental mutes to linguals and palatals.</center>\n\n196.

A dental surd mute or nasal, or the dental sibilant, when immediately preceded by a \u1e63, is everywhere converted into the corresponding lingual.\n\na. Under this rule, the combinations \u1e63\u1e6d, \u1e63\u1e6dh, and \u1e63\u1e47 are very common; \u1e63\u1e63 is rarely so written, the visarga being put instead of the former sibilant (172): thus, jy\u00f3ti\u1e25\u1e63u instead of jy\u00f3ti\u1e63\u1e63u.\n\nb. Much less often, dh is changed to \u1e0dh after final \u1e63 of a root or tense-stem, with loss of the \u1e63 or its conversion to \u1e0d: see 226 c.\n\nc. Those cases in which the final \u1e63 becomes \u1e6d before su (e.g. dvi\u1e6ds\u00fa: 226 b) do not, of course, fall under this rule.\n\n198. In the other (comparatively infrequent) cases where a dental is preceded by a lingual in internal combination, the dental (except of su loc. pl.) becomes lingual. Thus:\n\na. A n following immediately a \u1e47 made such by the rule given at 189, above\u2014or, as it may be expressed, a double as well as a single n\u2014is subject to the lingualization: thus, the participles ar\u1e47\u1e47\u00e1, k\u1e63u\u1e47\u1e47a, k\u1e63vi\u1e47\u1e47a, ch\u1e5b\u1e47\u1e47\u00e1, t\u1e5b\u1e47\u1e47\u00e1; and, after prefixes (185 a), ni\u1e63a\u1e47\u1e47a, parivi\u1e47\u1e47a, vi\u1e63a\u1e47\u1e47a, v\u00e1\u1e63ya\u1e47\u1e47a. But TS. has \u00e1dhi\u1e63kanna, and RV. y\u00e1ju\u1e25 \u1e63kann\u00e1m.\n\nb. Only a very few other instances occur: \u012b\u0301\u1e6d\u1e6de and \u0101\u0301i\u1e6d\u1e6da from \u221a\u012b\u1e0d; \u1e63a\u1e0d\u1e0dh\u0101\u0301 (also \u1e63a\u1e0ddh\u0101\u0301 and \u1e63o\u1e0dh\u0101\u0301), and \u1e63a\u1e47\u1e47\u0101\u0301m (\u1e63a\u1e63 + n\u0101m: anomalous gen. pl. of \u1e63a\u1e63: 483). A small number of words follow the same rule in external combination: see below, 199.\n\nc. But t\u0101\u1e0dhi (Vedic: \u221ata\u1e0d + dhi) shows loss of the final lingual after assimilation of the dental, and compensatory lengthening.\n\nd. Some of the cases of abnormal occurrence of \u1e0d are explained in a similar way, as results of a lingualized and afterwards omitted sibilant before d: thus n\u012b\u1e0d\u00e1 from nisda, \u221ap\u012b\u1e0d from pisd, \u221am\u1e5b\u1e0d from m\u1e5bsd. For words exhibiting a like change in composition, see below, 199 c.\n\n199. In external combination\u2014\n\na. A final t is directed to be assimilated to an initial lingual mute: thus, ta\u1e6d-\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101, ta\u1e0d \u1e0dayate, ta\u1e6d-\u1e6dh\u0101lin\u012b, ta\u1e0d \u1e0dh\u0101ukate: but the case never occurs in the older language, and very rarely in the later. For final n before a lingual, see 205 b.\n\nb. An initial dental after a final lingual usually remains unchanged; and su of the loc. pl. follows the same rule: thus, \u1e63\u00e1\u1e6dtri\u1e45\u00e7at, \u0101\u0301na\u1e0d div\u00e1\u1e25, ekar\u0101\u0301\u1e6d tv\u00e1m; \u1e63a\u1e6ds\u00fa, r\u0101\u1e6ds\u00fa.\n\nc. Exceptions are: a few compounds with \u1e63a\u1e63 ''six'' showing double \u1e47 (198 b): namely, \u1e63\u00e1\u1e47\u1e47avati, \u1e63a\u1e47\u1e47\u0101bhi (and one or two others not quotable): IB. has \u1e63a\u1e47 \u1e47iramim\u012bta.\n\nd.

Before the palatal sibilant \u0936\u094d \u00e7, both \u0924\u094d t and \u0928\u094d n are assimilated, becoming respectively \u091a\u094d c and \u091e\u094d \u00f1; and then the following \u0936\u094d \u00e7 may be, and in practice almost always is, converted to \u091b\u094d ch.\n\nThus, vedavic ch\u016bra\u1e25 (-vit \u00e7\u016b-), tac chrutv\u0101, h\u1e5bcchaya (h\u1e5bt + \u00e7aya); b\u1e5bha\u00f1 che\u1e63a\u1e25 or \u00e7e\u1e63a\u1e25, svapa\u00f1 chete or \u00e7ete.\n\na. Some authorities regard the conversion of \u00e7 to ch after t or n as everywhere obligatory, others as only optional; some except, peremptorily or optionally, a \u00e7 followed by a mute. And some require the same conversion after every mute save m, reading also v\u00edp\u0101\u1e6d chutudr\u012b\u0301, \u0101\u0301na\u1e6d ch\u00faci, anu\u1e63\u1e6dup ch\u0101rad\u012b, \u00e7uk chuci. The manuscripts generally write ch, instead of cch, as result of the combination of t and \u00e7.\n\nb. In the MS., t and \u00e7 are anomalously combined into \u00f1 \u00e7: e.g. t\u00e1\u00f1 \u00e7at\u00e1m, et\u0101va\u00f1\u00e7\u00e1s.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235461":{"pageid":235461,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/97","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n{{rh|69|Combination of Final n.|[-207}}\n\n\n</noinclude>{{c|Combinations of final \u0928\u094d n.}}\n\n204. Final radical n is assimilated in internal combination to a following sibilant, becoming anusv\u0101ra.\n\nThus, v\u00e1\u1e45si, v\u00e1\u1e45sva, v\u00e1\u1e45sat, ma\u1e45sy\u00e1te, j\u00edgh\u0101\u1e45sati.\n\na. According to the grammarians, it is treated before bh and su in declension as in external combination. But the cases are, at best, excessively rare, and RV. has r\u00e1\u1e45su and v\u00e1\u1e45su (the only Vedic examples).\n\nb. Final n of a derivative suffix is regularly and usually dropped before a consonant in inflection and composition\u2014in composition, even before a vowel; and a radical n occasionally follows the same rule: see 421 a, 439, 1203 c, 637.\n\nc. For assimilation of n to a preceding palatal, see 201.\n\nThus remaining cases are those of external combination.\n\n205. a. The assimilation of n in external combination to a following sonant palatal and the palatal sibilant \u00e7 have been already treated (202 b, 203).\n\nb. The n is also declared to be assimilated (becoming \u1e47) before a sonant lingual (\u1e0d, \u1e0dh, \u1e47), but the case rarely if ever occurs.\n\n20. A n is also assimilated to a following initial l, becoming (like m: 213 d) a nasal l.\n\na. The manuscripts to a great extent disregard this rule, leaving n unchanged; but also they in part attempt to follow it\u2014and that, either by writing the assimilated n (as the assimilated m, 213 f, and just as reasonably) with the anusv\u0101ra-sign, or else by doubling the l and putting a sign of nasality above; the latter, however, is inexact, and a better way would be to represent the two l's, writing the first with vir\u0101ma and a nasal sign above. Thus (from tr\u012bn lok\u0101n):\n\nmanuscripts \u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0932\u094b\u0915\u093e\u0928\u094d or \u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0932\u094d\u0932\u094b\u0901\u0915\u093e\u0928\u094d; better \u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0932\u094d\u0901 \u0932\u094b\u0915\u093e\u0928\u094d.\n\nThe second of these methods is the one oftenest followed in printed texts.\n\n207. Before the lingual and dental sibilants, \u1e63 and s, final n remains unchanged; but a t may also be inserted between the nasal and the sibilant: thus, t\u0101\u0301n \u1e63\u00e1\u1e6d or t\u0101\u0301nt \u1e63\u00e1\u1e6d; mah\u0101\u0301n s\u00e1n or mah\u0101\u0301nt s\u00e1n.\n\na. According to most of the grammarians of the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas (not RPr.), the insertion of the t in such cases is a necessary one. In the manuscripts it is very frequently made, but not uniformly. It is probably a purely phonetic phenomenon, a transitional-sound to ease the double change of a sonant to a surd and a nasal to a non-nasal utterance\u2014although the not infrequent cases in which final n stands for original nt (as in bharan, abharan, agnim\u0101n) may have aided to establish it as a rule. Its analogy with the conversion of n \u00e7 to \u00f1ch (203) is palpable.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235462":{"pageid":235462,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/98","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>208. Before the surd palatal, lingual, and dental mutes, there is inserted after final n a sibilant of each of those classes respectively, before which the n becomes anusv\u0101ra: thus, dev\u0101\u1e45\u00e7 ca, bhav\u0101\u1e45\u00e7 chidyate, kum\u0101r\u0101\u1e45s tr\u012bn, abhara\u1e45s tata\u1e25, dadha\u1e45\u00e7 (425 c) carum.</p>\n\na. This rule, which in the classical language has established itself in the form here given, as a phonetic rule of unvarying application, really involves a historic survival. The large majority of cases of final n in the language (not far from three quarters) are for original ns; and the retention of the sibilant in such cases, when once its historic ground had been forgotten, was extended by analogy to all others.\n\nb. Practically, the rule applies only to n before c and t, since cases involving the other initials occur either not at all, or only with extreme rarity (the Veda does not present an example of any of them). In the Veda, the insertion is not always made, and the different texts have with regard to its different usages, which are fully explained in the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas; in general, it is less frequent in the older texts. When the \u00e7 does not appear between n and c, the n is of course assimilated, becoming \u00f1 (203).\n\n209. The same retention of original final s after a nasal, and consequent treatment of (apparent) final \u0101n, \u012bn, \u016bn, \u1e5dn as if they were \u0101\u1e45s, \u012b\u1e45s, \u016b\u1e45s, \u1e5d\u1e45s (long nasalized vowel with final s), shows itself also in other Vedic forms of combination, which, for the sake of unity, may be briefly stated here together:\n\na. Final \u0101n becomes \u0101\u1e45 (nasalized \u0101) before a following vowel: that is to say, \u0101\u1e45s, with a nasal vowel, is treated like \u0101s, with pure vowel (177): thus, dev\u0101\u0301\u1e45 \u00e9 \u2019h\u00e1, \u00fapabaddh\u0101\u1e45 ih\u00e1, mah\u0101\u0301\u1e45 asi. This is an extremely common case, especially in RV. Once or twice, the s appears as \u1e25 before p; thus, sv\u00e1tav\u0101\u1e45\u1e25 p\u0101y\u00fa\u1e25.\n\nb. In like manner, s is treated after nasal \u012b, \u016b, \u1e5d as it would be after those vowels when pure, becoming r before a sonant sound (174), and (much more rarely) \u1e25 before a surd (170): thus, ra\u00e7m\u012b\u0301\u1e45r iva, s\u016bn\u016b\u0301\u1e45r yuvany\u016b\u0301\u1e45r \u00fat, n\u1e5d\u0301\u1e45r abh\u00ed; n\u1e5d\u0301\u1e45\u1e25 p\u0101\u0301tram (and n\u1e5d\u0301\u1e45\u1e63 p-, MS.).\n\nc. RV. has once -\u012b\u1e45 before y. MS. usually has a\u1e45 instead of \u0101\u1e45.\n\n210. The nasals n, \u1e47, n\u0304, occurring as finals after a short vowel, are doubled before any initial vowel: thus, praty\u00e1n\u0304n\u0304 \u00fad e\u1e63i, udy\u00e1nn \u0101dity\u00e1\u1e25, \u0101s\u00e1nn-i\u1e63u.\n\na. This is also to be regarded as a historical survival, the second nasal being an assimilation of an original consonant following the first. It is always written in the manuscripts, although the Vedic metre seems to show a duplication was sometimes omitted. The RV. has the compound v\u1e5b\u1e63a\u1e47a\u00e7va.\n\n211. The nasals \u00f1 and \u1e47 before a sibilant are allowed to insert respectively k and \u1e6d\u2014as n (207) inserts t: thus, praty\u00e1n\u0304k s\u00f3ma\u1e25.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235463":{"pageid":235463,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/99","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><center> Combinations of final \u092e\u094d m.</center>\n\n212.

Before m or v (as when final: 143 a), it is changed to n: thus, from \u221agam come \u00e1ganma, aganmahi, ganvahi, jaganv\u0101\u0301\u1e45s (which appear to be the only quotable cases). According to the grammarians, the same change is made in the inflection of root-stems before bh and su: thus, pra\u00e7\u0101nbhis, pra\u00e7\u0101nsu (from pra\u00e7\u0101m: pra + \u221a\u00e7am).

Final \u092e\u094d m in external combination is a servile sound, being assimilated to any following consonant. Thus:\n\na. It remains unchanged only before a vowel or labial mute.\n\nb. But also, by an anomalous exception, before r of the root r\u0101j in samr\u0101\u0301j and its derivatives samr\u0101\u0301j\u00f1\u012b and s\u0101mr\u0101jya.\n\nc. Before a mute of any other class than labial, it becomes a nasal of that class.\n\nd. Before the semivowels y, l, v it becomes, according to the Hindu grammarians, a nasal semivowel, the nasal counterpart of each respectively (see 71).\n\ne. Before r, a sibilant, or h, it becomes anusv\u0101ra (see 71).\n\nf. The manuscripts and the editions in general make no attempt to distinguish the nasal tones produced by the assimilation of m before a following semivowel from that before a spirant.\n\ng. But if h be immediately followed by another consonant (which can only be a nasal or semivowel), the m is allowed to be assimilated to that following consonant. This is because the h has no position of the mouth-organs peculiar to itself, but is uttered in the position of the next sound. The Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas do not take any notice of the case.\n\nh. Cases are met with in the Veda where a final m appears to be dropped before a vowel, the final and initial vowels being then combined into one. The pada-text then generally gives a wrong interpretation. Thus, sa\u1e41v\u00e1nano \u2019bhaya\u1e41kar\u00e1m (RV. viii. 1. 2; pada-text: -nan\u0101 ubh-; SV. -nanam).\n\ni. It has been pointed out above (73) that the assimilated m is generally represented in texts by the anusv\u0101ra-sign, and that in this work it is transliterated by \u1e41 (instead of a nasal mute or \u1e45).<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"235464":{"pageid":235464,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/100","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><center>The palatal mutes and sibilant, and \u0939\u094d h.</center>\n\n214. These sounds show in some situations a reversion (43) to the original gutturals from which they are derived. The treatment of j and h, also, is different, according as they represent the one or the other of two different degrees of alteration from their originals.\n\n215. The palatals and h are the least stable of alphabetic sounds, undergoing, in virtue of their derivative character, alteration in many cases where other similar sounds are retained.\n\n216. Thus, in derivation, even before vowels, semivowels; and nasals, reversion to guttural form is by no means rare. The cases are the following:\n\na.

In neka (\u221anij) we have further an anomalous substitution of a surd for the final sonant of the root.\n\nb. In another series of derivatives with a, the altered sound appears: examples are aj\u00e1, y\u0101ja, \u00e7uc\u00e1, \u00e7oca, vraj\u00e1, vevij\u00e1, yuja, \u016brj\u0101\u0301, d\u00f3ha.\n\nc.

Before u, the guttural reappears, as a rule (the cases are few): thus, \u00e1n\u0304ku, van\u0304k\u00fa, rek\u00fa, bh\u1e5b\u0301gu, m\u0101\u0301rguka, ragh\u00fa (and r\u00e1gh\u012bya\u1e45s).\n\nf. Before n, the examples of reversion are few, except of j (becoming g) before the participial ending na (957 c): thus, r\u00e9k\u1e47as, vagn\u00fa (with the final also made sonant); and participles bhagn\u00e1, rug\u1e47\u00e1, etc.; and apparently p\u1e5bg\u1e47a from \u221ap\u1e5bc.\n\ng. Before m (of ma, man, mant, min), the guttural generally appears: thus, rukm\u00e1, tigm\u00e1, yugma, \u1e5b\u0301gma (with sonant change); takm\u00e1n, v\u00e1kman, s\u00e1kman, yugm\u00e1n; r\u00fakmant; \u1e5bgm\u00edn and v\u0101gm\u00edn (with sonant change):\u2014but \u00e1jman, ojm\u00e1n, bhujm\u00e1n.\n\nh. Before y, the altered sound is used: thus, pacya, yajya, yajyu, yujya, bhujyu. Such cases as bhogya, yogya, negya, okya are doubtless secondary derivatives from bhoga etc.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]}}}}
