Examples of augmentless forms showing the accent belonging to the present-system are <tt>g\u0101\u0301yat, p\u00e1\u00e7yat, p\u00e1\u00e7yan, j\u0101\u0301yath\u0101s</tt>. \n\n761. The <tt>ya</tt>-class stems are more than a hundred and thirty in number, and nearly half of them have forms in use in all periods of the language, about forty occurring only in the earlier, and about thirty only in the modern period. \n\na. Of the roots making <tt>ya</tt>-stems, a very considerable part (over fifty) signify a state of feeling, or a condition of mind or body: thus, <tt>kup</tt> ''be angry'', <tt>klam</tt> ''be weary'', <tt>k\u1e63udh</tt> ''be hungry'', <tt>muh</tt> ''be confused'', <tt>lubh</tt> ''be lustful'', <tt>\u00e7u\u1e63</tt> ''be dry'', etc. etc. \n\nb. A further number have a more or less distinctly passive sense, and are in part evident and in part presumable transfers from the passive or <tt>y\u00e1</tt>-class, with change of accent, and sometimes also with assumption of active endings. It is not possible to draw precisely the limits of the division; but there are in the older language a number of clear cases, in which the accent wavers and changes, and the others are to be judged by analogy with them. Thus, \u221a<tt>muc</tt> forms <tt>m\u00facyate</tt> once or twice, beside the usual <tt>mucy\u00e1te</tt>, in RV. and AV.; and in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as the former is the regular accent. Similar changes are found also in <tt>ya</tt>-forms from other roots: thus, from <tt>k\u1e63i</tt> ''destroy'', <tt>j\u012b</tt> or <tt>jy\u0101</tt> ''injure'', <tt>tap</tt> ''heat'', <tt>d\u1e5bh</tt> ''make firm'', <tt>pac</tt> ''cook'', <tt>p\u1e5b</tt> ''fill'', <tt>m\u012b</tt> ''damage'', <tt>ric</tt> ''leave'', <tt>lup</tt> ''break'', <tt>h\u0101</tt> ''leave''. Active forms are early made from some of these, and they grow more common later. It is worthy of special mention that, from the Veda down, <tt>j\u0101\u0301yate</tt> ''is born'' etc. is found as altered passive or original <tt>ya</tt>-formation by the side of \u221a<tt>jan</tt> ''give birth''. \n\nc. A considerable body of roots (about forty) differ from the above in having an apparently original transitive or neuter meaning: examples are <tt>as</tt> ''throw'', <tt>nah</tt> ''bind'', <tt>pa\u00e7</tt> ''see'', <tt>pad</tt> ''go'', <tt>\u00e7li\u1e63</tt> ''clasp''. \n\nd. A number of roots, of various meaning, and of somewhat doubtful character and relations, having present-stems ending in <tt>ya</tt>, are by the native grammarians written with final diphthongs, <tt>\u0101i</tt> or <tt>e</tt> or <tt>o</tt>. Thus: \n\ne. Roots reckoned as ending in <tt>\u0101i</tt> and belonging to the <tt>a</tt>- (or <tt>bh\u016b-</tt>) class, as <tt>g\u0101i</tt> ''sing'' (<tt>g\u0101\u0301yati</tt> etc.). As these show abundantly, and for the most part exclusively, <tt>\u0101</tt>-forms outside the present-system, there seems to be no good reason why they should not rather be regarded as <tt>\u0101</tt>-roots of the <tt>ya</tt>-class. They are <tt>k\u1e63\u0101</tt> ''burn'', <tt>g\u0101</tt> ''sing'', <tt>gl\u0101</tt> ''be weary'', <tt>tr\u0101</tt> ''save'', <tt>dhy\u0101</tt> ''think'', <tt>py\u0101</tt> ''fill up'', <tt>ml\u0101</tt> ''relax'', <tt>r\u0101</tt> ''bark'', <tt>v\u0101</tt> ''be blown'', <tt>\u00e7y\u0101</tt> ''coagulate'', <tt>\u00e7r\u0101</tt> ''boil'', <tt>sty\u0101</tt> ''stiffen''. Some of them are evident extensions of simpler roots by the addition of <tt>\u0101</tt>. The secondary roots <tt>t\u0101y</tt> ''stretch'' (beside <tt>tan</tt>), and <tt>c\u0101y</tt> ''observe'' (beside <tt>ci</tt>) appear to be of similar character. \n\nf. Roots reckoned as ending in <tt>e</tt> and belonging to the <tt>a-</tt> (or <tt>bh\u016b-</tt>) class, as <tt>dhe</tt> ''suck'' (<tt>dh\u00e1yati</tt> etc.). These, too, have <tt>\u0101</tt>-forms, and sometimes <tt>\u012b</tt>-forms, outside the present system, and are best regarded as <tt>\u0101</tt>-roots, either with <tt>\u0101</tt> weakened to <tt>a</tt> before the class-sign of this class, or with <tt>\u0101</tt><noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"390641":{"pageid":390641,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/302","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>weakened to <tt>\u012b</tt> or <tt>i</tt> and inflected according to the <tt>a</tt>-class.

As of kindred form may be mentioned <tt>day</tt> ''share'' and <tt>vyay</tt> ''expend'' (probably denominative of <tt>vyaya</tt>). \n\ng. A few roots artificially written with final <tt>o</tt> and reckoned to the <tt>ya</tt>-class, with radical vowel lost before the class-sign: thus, <tt>do</tt> ''cut'', ''bind'', pres. <tt>dy\u00e1ti</tt> etc. These, as having an accented <tt>\u00e1</tt> in the sign, have plainly no right to be put in this class; and they are better referred to the <tt>\u00e1</tt>-class (see above, 753 c). Outside the present-system they show <tt>\u0101-</tt> and <tt>i</tt>-forms; and in that system the <tt>ya</tt> is often resolved into <tt>ia</tt> in the oldest language. \n\n762. The <tt>ya</tt>-class is the only one thus far described which shows any tendency toward a restriction to a certain variety of meaning. In this tendency, as well as in the form of its sign, it appears related with the class of distinctly defined meaning which is next to be taken up \u2014 the passive, with <tt>y\u00e1</tt>-sign. Though very far from being as widely used as the latter beside other present-systems, it is in some cases an intransitive conjugation by the side of a transitive of some other class. \n\n<center>Irregularities of the <tt>ya</tt>-class.</center> \n\n763. The roots of this class ending in <tt>am</tt> lengthen their vowel in forming the present-stem: they are <tt>klam, tam, dam, bhram, \u00e7am</tt> ''be quiet'', <tt>\u00e7ram</tt>: for example, <tt>t\u0101\u0301myati, \u00e7r\u0101\u0301myati</tt>. From <tt>k\u1e63am</tt>, however, only <tt>k\u1e63amyate</tt> occurs; and <tt>\u00e7am</tt> ''labor'' makes <tt>\u00e7amyati</tt> (B.). \n\n764. The root <tt>mad</tt> has the same lengthening: thus, <tt>m\u0101\u0301dyati</tt>. \n\n765. The roots in <tt>\u012bv</tt> \u2014 namely, <tt>d\u012bv, s\u012bv, sr\u012bv</tt> or <tt>\u00e7r\u012bv</tt>, and <tt>\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012bv</tt> (from which no forms of this class are quotable) \u2014 are written by the grammarians with <tt>iv</tt>, and a similar lengthening in the present-system is prescribed for them. \n\na. They appear to be properly <tt>d\u012b\u016b</tt> etc., since their vocalized final in other forms is always <tt>\u016b</tt>; <tt>d\u012bv</tt> is by this proved to have nothing to do with the assumed root <tt>div</tt> ''shine'', which changes to <tt>dyu</tt> (361 d): compare 240 b. \n\n766. From the roots <tt>j\u1e5b</tt> and <tt>t\u1e5b</tt> (also written as <tt>jur</tt> and <tt>tir</tt> or <tt>tur</tt>) come the stems <tt>j\u012b\u0301rya</tt> and <tt>t\u012b\u0301rya</tt>, and <tt>j\u016b\u0301rya</tt> and <tt>t\u016brya</tt> (the last two only in RV.); from <tt>p\u1e5b</tt> comes <tt>p\u016b\u0301rya</tt>. \n\n767. The root <tt>vyadh</tt> is abbreviated to <tt>vidh</tt>: thus, <tt>v\u00eddhyati</tt>. And any root which in other forms has a penultimate nasal loses it here: thus, <tt>d\u1e5b\u0301hya</tt> from <tt>d\u1e5b\u1e45h</tt> or <tt>d\u1e5bh</tt>; <tt>bhra\u00e7ya</tt> from <tt>bhra\u1e45\u00e7</tt> or <tt>bhra\u00e7</tt>; <tt>rajya</tt> from <tt>ra\u00f1j</tt> or <tt>raj</tt>. <noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"390644":{"pageid":390644,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/303","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><center>IX. Accented <tt>y\u00e1</tt>-class: Passive conjugation.</center> \n\n768. A certain form of present-stem, inflected with middle endings, is used only in a passive sense, and is formed from all roots for which there is occasion to make a passive conjugation. Its sign is an accented \u092f <tt>y\u00e1</tt> added to the root: thus, \u0939\u0928\u094d\u092f <tt>hany\u00e1</tt> from \u221a \u0939\u0928\u094d <tt>han</tt> ''slay'', \u0906\u092a\u094d\u092f <tt>\u0101py\u00e1</tt> from \u221a\u0906\u092a\u094d <tt>\u0101p</tt> ''obtain'',  \u0917\u0943\u0939\u092f <tt>grhy\u00e1</tt> from \u221a\u0917\u0943\u0939\u094d <tt>g\u1e5bh</tt> (or <tt>grah</tt>) ''seize'': and so on, without any reference to the class according to which the active and middle forms are made. \n\n769. The form of the root to which the passive-sign is added is (since the accent is on the sign) the weak one: thus, a penultimate nasal is dropped, and any abbreviation which is made in the weak forms of the perfect (794), in the aorist optative (922 b), or before <tt>ta</tt> of the passive participle (954), is made also in the passive present-system: thus, <tt>ajy\u00e1</tt> from \u221a<tt>a\u00f1j</tt>, <tt>badhy\u00e1</tt> from \u221a<tt>bandh</tt>, <tt>ucy\u00e1</tt> from \u221a<tt>vac</tt>, <tt>ijy\u00e1</tt> from \u221a<tt>yaj</tt>.\n\n770. On the other hand, a final vowel of a root is in general liable to the same changes as in other parts of the verbal system where it is followed by <tt>y</tt>: thus \u2014\n\na. Final <tt>i</tt> and <tt>u</tt> are lengthened: thus, <tt>m\u012by\u00e1</tt> from \u221a<tt>mi</tt>; <tt>s\u016by\u00e1</tt> from \u221a<tt>su</tt>; \n\nb. Final <tt>\u0101</tt> is usually changed to <tt>\u012b</tt>: thus, <tt>d\u012by\u00e1</tt> from \u221a<tt>d\u0101</tt>; <tt>h\u012by\u00e1</tt> from \u221a<tt>h\u0101</tt>: but <tt>j\u00f1\u0101y\u00e1</tt> from \u221a<tt>j\u00f1\u0101</tt>, and so <tt>khy\u0101y\u00e1</tt>, <tt>kh\u0101y\u00e1</tt>, <tt>mn\u0101y\u00e1</tt>, etc.; \n\nc. Final <tt>\u1e5b</tt> is in general changed to <tt>ri</tt>: thus, <tt>kriy\u00e1</tt> from \u221a<tt>k\u1e5b</tt>; but if preceded by two consonants (and also, it is claimed, in the root <tt>\u1e5b</tt>), it has instead the <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening: thus, <tt>smary\u00e1</tt> from \u221a<tt>sm\u1e5b</tt> (the only quotable case); \u2014 and in those roots which show a change of <tt>\u1e5b</tt> to <tt>ir</tt> and <tt>ur</tt> (so-called <tt>\u1e5d</tt>-verbs: see 242), that change is made here also, and the vowel is lengthened: thus, <tt>\u00e7\u012brya</tt> from \u221a<tt>\u00e7\u1e5b</tt>, <tt>p\u016bry\u00e1</tt> from \u221a<tt>p\u1e5b</tt>.\n\n771. The inflectiom of the passive-stem is precisely like that of the other <tt>a</tt>-stems; it differs only in accent from that of the class last given.

The corresponding form to \u221a<tt>jan</tt>, namely <tt>j\u0101\u0301yate</tt> (above, 761 b), is apparently a transfer to the preceding class. \n\n773. By their form, <tt>mriy\u00e1te</tt> ''dies'', and <tt>dhriy\u00e1te</tt> ''maintains itself, is steadfast'', are passives from the roots <tt>m\u1e5b</tt> ''die'' and <tt>dh\u1e5b</tt> ''hold''; although neither is used in a proper passive sense, and <tt>m\u1e5b</tt> is not transitive except in the derivative form <tt>m\u1e5b\u1e47</tt> (above, 731). With them are to be compared the stems <tt>\u0101-driy\u00e1</tt> ''heed'' and <tt>\u0101-priy\u00e1</tt> ''be busy'', which are perhaps peculiar adaptations of meaning of passives from the roots <tt>d\u1e5b</tt> ''pierce'' and <tt>p\u1e5b</tt> ''fill''. \n\n774. Examples of the transfer of stems from the <tt>y\u00e1-</tt> or passive class to the <tt>ya-</tt> or intransitive class were given above (761 b); and it was also pointed out that active instead of middle endings are occasionally, even in the earlier language, assumed by forms properly passive: examples are <tt>\u0101\u0301 dhm\u0101yati</tt> and <tt>vy \u00e0pru\u1e63yat</tt> (\u00c7B.), <tt>bh\u016byati</tt> (M\u0101iU.). In the epics, however (as a part of their general confusion of active and middle forms: 529 a), active endings are by no means infrequently taken by the passive: thus, <tt>\u00e7akyati, \u00e7r\u016byanti, bhriyantu, ijyant-</tt>, etc. \n\n<center>The so-called Tenth or <tt>cur</tt>-Class.</center> \n\n775. As was noticed above (607), the Hindu grammarians \u2014 and, after their example, most European also \u2014 recognize yet another conjugation-class, co\u00f6rdinate with those already described; its stems show the class-sign <tt>\u00e1ya</tt>, added to a generally strengthened root (for details as to the strengthening, see 1042). Though this is no proper class, but a secondary or derivative conjugation (its stems are partly of causative formation, partly denominative with altered accent), an abbreviated example of its forms may, for the sake of accordance with other grammars, be added here. \n\na.

The uses of the mode-forms of the present-system have been already briefly treated in the preceding chapter (572 ff.). The tense-uses of the two indicative tenses, present and imperfect, call here for only a word or two of explanation. \n\n777. The present has, besides its strictly present use, the same subsidiary uses which belong in general to the tense: namely, the expression of habitual action, of future action, and of past action in lively narration. \n\na. Examples of future meaning are: <tt>im\u00e1\u1e41 c\u00e9d v\u0101\u0301 im\u00e9 cinv\u00e1te t\u00e1ta ev\u00e1 no \u2018bh\u00edbhavanti</tt> (\u00c7B.)

''Agni gave his own presence wherever the Nishadhan should desire''; <tt>sv\u0101gata\u1e41 te \u2018stu ki\u1e41 karomi tava</tt> (R.) ''welcome to thee; what shall I do for thee? ''\n\nb. Examples of past meaning are: \u00fattar\u0101 s\u016b\u0301r \u00e1dhara\u1e25 putr\u00e1 \u0101s\u012bd d\u0101\u0301nu\u1e25 \u00e7aye sah\u00e1vats\u0101 n\u00e1 dhen\u00fa\u1e25 (RV.)

''thereupon they all fall to reproaching him by whose advice they had alighted there.'' \n\n778. In connection with certain particles, the present has rather more definitely the value of a past tense. Thus: \n\na. With <tt>pur\u0101\u0301</tt> ''formerly'': thus, <tt>saptar\u1e63\u012b\u0301n u ha sma v\u0101\u00ed pur\u00e1 rk\u1e63\u0101 \u00edty \u0101\u0301cak\u1e63ate</tt> (\u00c7B.)

''if you have never before given me even an atom.'' \n\nb. With the asseverative particle <tt>sma</tt>: thus, <tt>\u00e7r\u00e1me\u1e47a ha sma v\u0101\u00ed t\u00e1d dev\u0101\u0301 jayanti y\u00e1d e\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 j\u00e1yyam \u0101\u0301s\u00e1 r\u1e63aya\u00e7 ca</tt> (\u00c7B.)

''then Nala, being possessed by Kali, was beaten in play. ''\n\nc. No example of this last construction is found in either RV. or AV., or elsewhere in the metrical parts of the Veda. In the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, only habitual action is expressed by it. At all periods of the language, the use of <tt>sma</tt> with a verb as pure asseverative particle, with no effect on the tense-meaning, is very common; and the examples later are hardly to be distinguished from the present of lively narration \u2014 of which the whole construction is doubtless a form. \n\n779. The imperfect has remained unchanged in value through the whole history of the language; it is the tense of narration; it expresses simple past time, without any other implication. \n\na.

In the oldest language, the perfect has also its modes and its augment-preterit, or pluperfect, or is not less full in its apparatus of forms than is the present-system (see 808 ff.). \n\n781. The formation of the perfect is essentially alike in all verbs, differences among them being of only subordinate consequence, or having the character of irregularities. The characteristics of the formation are these: \n\n1. a stem made by reduplication of the root; \n\n2. a distinction between stronger and weaker forms of stem, the former being used (as in presents of the First or non-<tt>a</tt>-conjugation) in the singular active, the latter in all other persons; \n\n3. endings in some respects peculiar, unlike those of the present; \n\n4. the frequent use, especially in the later language, of a union-vowel \u0907 <tt>i</tt> between stem and endings. \n\n782. Reduplication. In roots beginning with a consonant, the reduplication which forms the perfect-stem is of the same character with that which forms the present-stem of the reduplicating conjugation-class (see 643) \u2014 but with this exception, that radical \u0905 <tt>a</tt> and \u0906 <tt>\u0101</tt>  and \u090b <tt>\u1e5b</tt> (or \u0905\u0930\u094d <tt>ar</tt>) have only \u0905 <tt>a</tt>, and never \u0907 <tt>i</tt>, as vowel of the reduplicating syllable: thus, from \u221a\u092a\u0943 <tt>p\u1e5b</tt> ''fill'' comes the present-stem \u092a\u093f\u092a\u0943 <tt>pip\u1e5b</tt>, but the perfect-stem \u092a\u092a\u0943 <tt>pap\u1e5b</tt>; from \u221a\u092e\u093e <tt>m\u0101</tt><noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"397597":{"pageid":397597,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/325","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><center><big>CHAPTER XI.</big> \n\n\nTHE AORIST SYSTEMS.</center> \n\n824. {{sc|Under}} the name of aorist are included (as was pointed out above, 532) three quite distinct formations, each of which has its sub-varieties: namely \u2014\n\nI. A {{sc|simple aorist}} (equivalent to the Greek \"second aorist\"), analogous in all respects as to form and inflection with the imperfect. It has two varieties: 1. the root-aorist, with a tense-stem identical with the root (corresponding to an imperfect of the root-class); 2. the <tt>a</tt>-aorist, with a tense-stem ending in \u0905 <tt>\u00e1</tt>, or with union-vowel \u0905 <tt>a</tt> before the endings (corresponding to an imperfect of the <tt>\u00e1</tt>-class). \n\nII. 3. A {{sc|reduplicating aorist}}, perhaps in origin identical with an imperfect of the reduplicating class, but having come to be separated from it by marked peculiarities of form. It usually has a union-vowel \u0905 <tt>a</tt> before the endings, or is inflected like an imperfect of one of the <tt>a</tt>-classes; but a few forms occur in the Veda without such vowel. \n\nIII. A {{sc|sigmatic}} or {{sc|sibilant aorist}} (corresponding to the Greek \"first aorist\"), having for its tense-sign a \u0938\u094d <tt>s</tt> added to the root, either directly or with a preceding auxiliary \u0907 <tt>i</tt>; its endings are usually added immediately to the tense-sign, but in a small number of roots with a union-vowel \u0905 <tt>a</tt>; a very few roots also are increased by \u0938\u094d <tt>s</tt> for its formation; and according to these differences it falls into four varieties: namely, A. without union-vowel  \u0905 <tt>a</tt> before endings; 4. <tt>s</tt>-aorist, with \u0938\u094d <tt>s</tt> alone added to the root; 5. <tt>i\u1e63</tt>-aorist, the same with interposed \u0907 <tt>i</tt>; 6. <tt>si\u1e63</tt>-aorist, the same as the preceding with  \u0938\u094d <tt>s</tt> added at the end of the root; B. with union-vowel  \u0905 <tt>a</tt>, 7. <tt>sa</tt>-aorist.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"409639":{"pageid":409639,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/326","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\n825. All these varieties are bound together and made into a single complex system by certain correspondences of form and meaning. Thus, in regard to form, they are all alike, in the indicative, augment-preterits to which there does not exist any corresponding present; in regard to meaning, although in the later or classical language they are simply preterits, exchangeable with imperfects and perfects, they all alike have in the older language the general value of a completed past or \"perfect\", translatable by ''have done'' and the like. \n\n826. The aorist-system is a formation of infrequent occurrence in much of the classical Sanskrit (its forms are found, for example, only twenty-one times in the Nala, eight in the Hitopade\u00e7a, seven in Manu, six each in the Bhagavad-G\u012bt\u0101 and \u00c7akuntal\u0101, and sixty-six times, from fourteen roots, in the first book, of about 2600 lines, of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a: compare 927 b), and it possesses no participle, nor any modes (excepting in the prohibitive use of its augmentless forms: see 579; and the so-called precative: see 921 ff.); in the older language, on the other hand, it is quite common, and has the whole variety of modes belonging to the present, and sometimes participles. Its description, accordingly, must be given mainly as that of a part of the older language, with due notice of its restriction in later use. \n\n827. a. In the RV., nearly half the roots occurring show aorist forms, of one or another class; in the AV., rather less than one third; and in the other texts of the older language comparatively few aorists occur which are not found in these two. \n\nb. More than fifty roots, in RV. and AV. together, make aorist forms of more than one class (not taking into account the reduplicated or \"causative\" aorist); but no law appears to underlie this variety; of any relation such as is taught by the grammarians, between active of one class and middle of another as correlative, there is no trace discoverable. \n\nc. Examples are: of classes 1 and 4, <tt>adh\u0101m</tt> and <tt>dh\u0101sus</tt> from \u221a<tt>dh\u0101</tt>, <tt>ayuji</tt> and <tt>ayuk\u1e63ata</tt> from \u221a<tt>yuj</tt>; \u2014  of 1 and 5, <tt>agrabham</tt> and <tt>agrabh\u012b\u1e63ma</tt> from \u221a<tt>grabh</tt>, <tt>m\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101s</tt> and <tt>mar\u1e63i\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101s</tt> from \u221a<tt>m\u1e5b\u1e63</tt>; \u2014 of 1 and 2, <tt>\u0101rta</tt> and <tt>ar\u0101t</tt> from \u221a<tt>\u1e5b</tt>; \u2014 of 2 and 4, <tt>avidam</tt> and <tt>avitsi</tt> from \u221a<tt>vid</tt> ''find'', <tt>anijam</tt> and <tt>an\u0101ik\u1e63\u012bt</tt> from \u221a<tt>nij</tt>; \u2014 of 2 and 5, <tt>san\u00e9ma</tt> and <tt>as\u0101ni\u1e63am</tt> from \u221a<tt>san</tt>; of 2 and 7, <tt>aruham</tt> and <tt>aruk\u1e63at</tt> from \u221a<tt>ruh</tt>; \u2014 of 4 and 5, <tt>amatsus</tt> and <tt>am\u0101di\u1e63us</tt> from \u221a<tt>mad</tt>; \u2014 of 4 and 6, <tt>h\u0101smahi</tt> and <tt>h\u0101si\u1e63us</tt> from \u221a<tt>h\u0101</tt>; \u2014 of 1 and 2 and 4, <tt>atnata</tt> and <tt>atanat</tt> and <tt>at\u0101n</tt> from \u221a<tt>tan</tt>; \u2014 of 1 and 4 and 5, <tt>abudhran</tt> and <tt>\u00e1bhutsi</tt> and <tt>b\u00f3dhi\u1e63at</tt> from \u221a<tt>budh</tt>, <tt>\u00e1star</tt> and <tt>st\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bya</tt> and<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"412097":{"pageid":412097,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/308","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>''measure'' comes the present-stem \u092e\u093f\u092e\u093e <tt>mim\u0101</tt>, but the perfect-stem \u092e\u092e\u093e <tt>mam\u0101</tt>; and so on. \n\na. Irregularities of roots with initial consonants will be given below, 784. \n\n783. For roots beginning with a vowel, the rules of reduplication are these: \n\na. A root with initial \u0905 <tt>a</tt> before a single final consonant repeats the \u0905 <tt>a</tt>, which then fuses with the radical vowel to \u0906 <tt>\u0101</tt> (throughout the whole inflection): thus, \u0906\u0926\u094d <tt>\u0101d</tt> from \u221a\u0905\u0926\u094d <tt>ad</tt> ''eat''; and in like manner \u0906\u091c\u094d <tt>\u0101j</tt>, \u0906\u0928\u094d <tt>\u0101n</tt>, \u0906\u0938\u094d <tt>\u0101s</tt>, \u0906\u0939\u094d <tt>\u0101h</tt>. The root \u090b <tt>\u1e5b</tt> forms likewise throughout \u0906\u0930\u094d <tt>\u0101r</tt> (as if from \u0905\u0930\u094d <tt>ar</tt>). \n\nb. A root with \u0907 <tt>i</tt> or \u0909 <tt>u</tt> before a single final consonant follows the same analogy, except in the strong forms (sing. act.); here the vowel of the radical syllable has <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>, becoming \u090f <tt>e</tt> or \u0913 <tt>o</tt>; and before this, the reduplicating vowel maintains its independent form, and is separated from the radical syllable by its own semivowel: thus, from \u221a\u0907\u0937\u094d <tt>i\u1e63</tt> comes \u0908\u0937\u094d <tt>\u012b\u1e63</tt> in weak forms, but \u0907\u092f\u0947\u0937\u094d <tt>iye\u1e63</tt> in strong; from \u221a\u0909\u091a\u094d <tt>uc</tt>, in like manner, come \u090a\u091a\u094d <tt>\u016bc</tt> and \u0909\u0935\u094b\u091a\u094d <tt>uvoc</tt>. The root \u0907 <tt>i</tt>, a single vowel, also falls under this rule, and forms \u0908\u092f\u094d <tt>\u012by</tt> (<tt>y</tt> added before a vowel) and \u0907\u092f\u0947 <tt>iye</tt>.\n\nc. Roots which begin with vowels long by nature or by position do not in general make a perfect-system, but use instead a periphrastic formation, in which the perfect tense of an auxiliary verb is added to the accusative of a verbal noun (see below, chap. XV.: 107O ff.). \n\nd. To this rule, however, \u221a<tt>\u0101p</tt> (probably originally <tt>ap</tt>: 1087 f) constitutes an exception, making the constant perfect-stem <tt>\u0101p</tt>  (as if from <tt>ap</tt>: above, a). Also are met with <tt>\u012b\u1e0d\u00e9</tt> (RV.) and <tt>\u012b\u1e0dire</tt> from \u221a<tt>\u012b\u1e0d</tt>, and <tt>\u012brir\u00e9</tt> (V.) from \u221a<tt>\u012br</tt>. \n\ne. For the peculiar reduplication <tt>\u0101n</tt>, belonging to certain roots with initial vowels, see below, 788. \n\n784. A number of roots beginning with <tt>va</tt> and ending with a single consonant, which in various of their verbal forms and derivatives abbreviate the <tt>va</tt> to <tt>u</tt>, do it also in the perfect, and are treated like roots with initial <tt>u</tt> (above, 783 b), except that they retain<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"412593":{"pageid":412593,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/309","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>the full form of root in the strong persons of the singular active.

Other sporadic cases occur. \n\nb. A single root with <tt>va</tt> is treated in the same way: namely <tt>svap</tt>, which forms <tt>su\u1e63vap</tt>. \n\nc. These roots are for the most part abbreviated in the weak forms: see below, 794. \n\n786. A considerable number of roots have in the Veda a long \nvowel in their reduplication. \n\na.

The later grammar, then, sets up the rule that roots beginning with <tt>a</tt> and ending with more than one consonant have <tt>\u0101n</tt> as their regular reduplication; and such perfects are taught from roots like <tt>ak\u1e63</tt>, <tt>arj</tt>, and <tt>a\u00f1c</tt> or <tt>ac</tt>; but the only other quotable forms appear to be <tt>\u0101narchat</tt> (MBh.) and <tt>\u0101nar\u1e63at</tt> (TA.); which are accordingly reckoned as \"pluperfects\". \n\n789. One or two individual cases of irregularity are the following: \n\na. The extremely common root <tt>bh\u016b</tt> ''be'' has the anomalous reduplication <tt>ba</tt>, forming the stem <tt>babh\u016b</tt>; and, in the Veda, \u221a<tt>s\u016b</tt> forms in like manner <tt>sas\u016b</tt>.\n\nb. The root <tt>bh\u1e5b</tt> ''bear'' has in the Veda the anomalous reduplication <tt>ja</tt> (as also in intensive: 1002); but RV. has once also the regular <tt>babhre</tt>, and pple <tt>babhr\u0101\u1e47\u00e1</tt>.\n\nc. The root <tt>\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012bv</tt> ''spew'' forms either <tt>ti\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012bv</tt> (\u00c7B. et al.) or <tt>\u1e6di\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012bv</tt> (not quotable).\n\nd. <tt>Vivakv\u0101\u0301n</tt> (RV., once) is doubtless participle of \u221a<tt>vac</tt>, with irregular reduplication (as in the present, 660). \n\n790. Absence of reduplication is met with in some cases. Thus: \n\na. The root <tt>vid</tt> ''know'' has, from the earliest period to the latest, a perfect without reduplication, but otherwise regularly made and inflected: thus, <tt>v\u00e9da</tt>, <tt>v\u00e9ttha</tt>, etc., pple <tt>vidv\u0101\u0301\u1e45s</tt>. It has the meaning of a present. The root <tt>vid</tt> ''find'' forms the regular <tt>viv\u00e9da</tt>.\n\nb. A few other apparently perfect forms lacking a reduplication are found in RV.: they are <tt>tak\u1e63athus</tt> and <tt>tak\u1e63us</tt>, <tt>yam\u00e1tus, skambh\u00e1thus</tt> and <tt>skambhus, nindima</tt> (for <tt>ninidima</tt>?), <tt>dhi\u1e63e</tt> and <tt>dhire</tt> (? \u221a<tt>dh\u0101</tt>), and <tt>vidr\u00e9</tt> and <tt>arhire</tt> (? see 613). And AV. VS. have <tt>cetatus</tt>. The participial words <tt>d\u0101\u00e7v\u0101\u0301\u1e45s, m\u012b\u1e0dhv\u0101\u0301\u1e45s, s\u0101hv\u0101\u0301\u1e45s</tt> are common in the oldest language; and RV. has once <tt>j\u0101n\u00fa\u1e63as</tt> (\u221a<tt>j\u00f1\u0101</tt>), and <tt>khidvas</tt> (voc.), perhaps for <tt>cikhidvas</tt>.\n\nc.

For an anomalous case or two of reduplicated preposition, see below, 1087f.\n\n792. Strong and weak stem-forms. In the three \npersons of the singular active, the root-syllable is accented, \nand exhibits usually a stronger form than in the rest of the \ntense-inflection. The difference is effected partly by strengthening the root in the three persons referred to, partly by weakening it in the others, partly by doing both. \n\n793. As regards the strengthening: \n\na. A final vowel takes either the <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt> or <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt> change in 1st sing. act., <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt> in 2d, and <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt> in 3d: thus, from \u221a\u092d\u0940 <tt>bh\u012b</tt>, 1st \u092c\u093f\u092d\u0947 <tt>bibh\u00e9</tt> or \u092c\u093f\u092d\u0948 <tt>bibh\u0101\u00ed</tt>; 2d \u092c\u093f\u092d\u0947 <tt>bibh\u00e9</tt>; 3d \n\u092c\u093f\u092d\u0948 <tt>bibh\u0101\u00ed</tt>; from \u221a\u0915\u0943 <tt>k\u1e5b</tt>, 1st \u091a\u0915\u0930\u094d <tt>cak\u00e1r</tt> or \u091a\u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d <tt>cak\u0101\u0301r</tt>, 2d \u091a\u0915\u0930\u094d <tt>cak\u00e1r</tt>, 3d \u091a\u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d <tt>cak\u0101\u0301r</tt>. \n\nb. But the <tt>\u016b</tt> of \u221a<tt>bh\u016b</tt> remains unchanged, and adds <tt>v</tt> before a vowel-ending: thus, <tt>babh\u016b\u0301va</tt> etc.\n\nc. Medial \u0905 <tt>a</tt> before a single final consonant follows \nthe analogy of a final vowel, and is lengthened or vriddhied \nin the 3d. sing., and optionally in the first: thus, from \n\u221a\u0924\u092a\u094d <tt>tap</tt>, 1st \u0924\u0924\u092a\u094d <tt>tat\u00e1p</tt> or \u0924\u0924\u093e\u092a\u094d <tt>tat\u0101\u0301p</tt>, 2d \u0924\u0924\u092a\u094d <tt>tat\u00e1p</tt>, 3d \u0924\u0924\u093e\u092a\u094d <tt>tat\u0101\u0301p</tt>. \n\nd. In the earlier language, however, the weaker of the two forms \nallowed by these rules in the first person is almost exclusively in use: thus, 1st only <tt>bibh\u00e1ya</tt>, <tt>tat\u00e1pa</tt>; 3d <tt>bibh\u0101\u0301ya</tt>, <tt>tat\u0101\u0301pa</tt>. Exceptions are <tt>cak\u0101ra</tt> and <tt>jagr\u0101\u0301ha</tt> (doubtful reading) in AV., <tt>cak\u0101ra</tt> in A\u00c7S. and BAU. (\u00c7B. <tt>cakara</tt>), <tt>jig\u0101ya</tt> in A\u00c7S., as first persons.\n\ne. A medial short vowel has in all three persons alike \nthe <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening (where this is possible: 240): thus, from \u221a\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0941\u0939\u094d <tt>druh</tt> comes \u0926\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0939\u094d <tt>dudr\u00f3h</tt>; from \u221a\u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d <tt>vi\u00e7</tt> comes \u0935\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0936\u094d <tt>viv\u00e9\u00e7</tt>; from \u221a\u0915\u0943\u0924\u094d <tt>k\u1e5bt</tt> comes \u091a\u0915\u0930\u094d\u0924\u094d <tt>cak\u00e1rt</tt>. \n\nf. An initial short vowel before a single final consonant is to be treated like a medial, but the quotable examples are very few: namely, <tt>iye\u1e63a</tt> from \u221a<tt>i\u1e63</tt> ''seek'', <tt>uvocitha</tt> and <tt>uvoca</tt> from \u221a<tt>uc</tt>, <tt>uvo\u1e63a</tt> from \u221a<tt>u\u1e63</tt>.

The earlier language, however, affords no example of a 2d sing., whatever its ending, accented on any other than the radical syllable, or failing to conform to the rules of strengthening as given above (in a, c, e). \n\nh. Occasional instances of strengthening in other than the singular persons are met with: thus, <tt>yuyopima</tt> and <tt>vive\u00e7us</tt> (RV.), <tt>paspar\u00e7us</tt> (KeU.), and, in the epics, <tt>cakartus</tt> and <tt>cakartire</tt>, <tt>cakar\u1e63atus</tt>, <tt>jug\u016bhire</tt>, <tt>nan\u0101mire</tt>, <tt>bibhedus</tt>, <tt>vav\u0101hatus</tt>, <tt>vive\u00e7atus</tt>, <tt>vavar\u1e63us</tt>.

The root <tt>m\u1e5bj</tt> has (as in the present-system: 627) <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt> instead of <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt> in strong forms: thus, <tt>mam\u0101\u0301rja</tt>; and \u221a<tt>guh</tt> (also as in present: 745 c) has <tt>\u016b</tt> instead of <tt>o</tt> (but also <tt>juguhe</tt> E.). \n\n794. As regards the weakening in weak forms: \n\na. It has been seen above (783 b) that roots beginning with <tt>i</tt> or <tt>u</tt> fuse reduplicating and radical syllable together to <tt>\u012b</tt> or <tt>\u016b</tt> in the weak forms; and (784) that roots contracting <tt>va</tt> and <tt>ya</tt> to <tt>u</tt> or <tt>i</tt> in the reduplication do it also in the root in weak forms, the two elements here also coalescing to <tt>\u016b</tt> or <tt>\u012b</tt>. \n\nb. A few roots having <tt>ya</tt> and <tt>va</tt> after a first initial consonant, and reduplicating from the semivowel (785), contract the <tt>ya</tt> and <tt>va</tt> to <tt>i</tt> and <tt>u</tt>: thus, <tt>vivic</tt> from \u221a<tt>vyac</tt>, <tt>vividh</tt> from \u221a<tt>vyadh</tt> (but <tt>vivyadhus</tt> MBh.), <tt>su\u1e63up</tt> from \u221a<tt>svap</tt>. The extended roots <tt>jy\u0101</tt>, <tt>py\u0101</tt>, <tt>vy\u0101</tt>, <tt>\u00e7v\u0101</tt>, <tt>hv\u0101</tt> show a similar apparent contraction, making their weak forms from the simpler roots <tt>j\u012b, p\u012b, v\u012b, \u00e7\u016b, h\u016b</tt>, while <tt>hv\u0101</tt> must and <tt>\u00e7v\u0101</tt> may get their strong forms also from the same (and only <tt>jijy\u0101\u00fa</tt> is quotable from the others). \n\nc. The root <tt>grabh</tt> or <tt>grah</tt> (if it be written thus: see 729 a) contracts to <tt>g\u1e5bh</tt>, making the three forms of stem <tt>jagr\u00e1h</tt> (1st and 2d sing. act.), <tt>jagr\u0101\u0301h</tt> (3d), and <tt>jag\u1e5bh</tt>; but <tt>prach</tt> (if it be so written: see 756 a) remains unchanged throughout.\n\nd.

The ending <tt>mas</tt> instead of <tt>ma</tt> is found in <tt>\u00e7u\u00e7rumas</tt> (E.C.). For the alleged occurrence of <tt>\u1e0dhve</tt> instead of <tt>dhve</tt> in 2d pl. mid., see 226 c. \n\n796. Those of the endings which begin with a consonant \u2014 namely \u0925 <tt>tha</tt>, \u0935 <tt>va</tt>, \u092e <tt>ma</tt> in active; \u0938\u0947 <tt>se</tt>, \u0935\u0939\u0947 <tt>vahe</tt>, \u092e\u0939\u0947 <tt>mahe</tt>, \u0927\u094d\u0935\u0947 <tt>dhve</tt>, \u0930\u0947 <tt>re</tt> in middle \u2014 are very often, and in the later language usually, joined to the base with the help of an interposed union-vowel \u0907 <tt>i</tt>. \n\na. The union-vowel <tt>i</tt> is found widely used also in other parts of the general verbal system: namely, in the sibilant aorist, the futures, and the verbal nouns and adjectives (as also in other classes of derivative stems). In the later language, a certain degree of correspondence is seen among the different parts of the same verb, as regards their use or non-use of the connective; but this correspondence is not so close that general rules respecting it can be given with advantage; and it will be best to treat each formation by itself. \n\nb. The perfect is the tense in which the use of <tt>i</tt> has established itself most widely and firmly in the later language. \n\n797. The most important rules as to the use of \u0907 <tt>i</tt> in the later language are as follows: \n\na. The \u0930\u0947 <tt>re</tt> of 3d pl. mid. has it always. \n\nb. The other consonant-endings, except \u0925 <tt>tha</tt> of 2d sing. act., take it in nearly all verbs.\n\nc. But it is rejected throughout by eight verbs \u2014 namely <tt>k\u1e5b</tt> ''make'', <tt>bh\u1e5b</tt> ''bear'', <tt>s\u1e5b</tt> ''go'', <tt>v\u1e5b</tt> ''choose'', <tt>dru</tt> ''run'', <tt>\u00e7ru</tt> ''hear'', <tt>stu</tt> ''praise'', <tt>sru</tt> ''flow''; and it is allowably (not usually) rejected by some others, in general accordance with their usage in other formations. \n\nd. In 2d sing. act., it is rejected not only by the eight verbs just given, but also by many others, ending in vowels or in consonants, which in other formations have no \u0907 <tt>i</tt>; but it is also taken by many verbs which reject it in other formations; \u2014 and it is optional in many verbs, including those in \u0906 <tt>\u0101</tt> (of which the \u0906 <tt>\u0101</tt> is lost when the ending is \u0907\u0925 <tt>itha</tt>), and most of those in \u0907 <tt>i</tt>, \u0908 <tt>\u012b</tt>, and \u0909 <tt>u</tt>. \n\ne. The rules of the grammarians, especially as regards the use of <tt>tha</tt> or <tt>itha</tt>, run out into infinite detail, and are not wholly consistent with one another; and, as the forms are very infrequent, it is not possible to criticise the statements made, and to tell how far they are founded on the facts of usage.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"412895":{"pageid":412895,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/315","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{blank line}}\nf. With this <tt>i</tt>, a final radical <tt>i</tt> or <tt>\u012b</tt> is not combined, but changed into <tt>y</tt> or <tt>iy</tt>. The <tt>\u016b</tt> of \u221a<tt>bh\u016b</tt> becomes <tt>\u016bv</tt> throughout before a vowel. \n\n798. In the older language, the usage is in part quite otherwise. Thus.\n\na. In the RV., the union-vowel <tt>i</tt> is taken by roots ending in consonants provided the last syllable of the stem is a heavy one, but not otherwise: thus, <tt>\u0101\u0301sitha, uv\u00f3citha, viv\u00e9ditha</tt>, but <tt>tat\u00e1ntha</tt> and <tt>vivy\u00e1ktha</tt>; <tt>\u016bcim\u00e1, paptima, sedima, yuyopim\u00e1</tt>, but <tt>jaganma, jag\u1e5bbhm\u00e1, yuyujma; \u016b\u00e7i\u1e63\u00e9, jaj\u00f1i\u1e63\u00e9, sas\u0101hi\u1e63e</tt>, but <tt>vivitse</tt> and <tt>dad\u1e5bk\u1e63\u00e9</tt>; <tt>bubhujm\u00e1he</tt> and <tt>\u00e7\u0101\u00e7admahe</tt> etc. (no examples of <tt>ivahe</tt> or <tt>imahe</tt> chance to occur, nor any of either <tt>idhve</tt> or <tt>dhve</tt>); <tt>\u012bjir\u00e9, jaj\u00f1ir\u00e9, yetir\u00e9, tataksir\u00e9</tt>, but <tt>c\u0101k\u1e37pr\u00e9, vividr\u00e9, duduhr\u00e9, pasp\u1e5bdhr\u00e9, tatasr\u00e9</tt> (and so on: twenty-two forms). The only exception in RV. is <tt>v\u00e9ttha</tt> from \u221a<tt>vid</tt>, without <tt>i</tt> (in Br., also <tt>\u0101ttha</tt> from \u221a<tt>ah</tt>: below, 801 a). The other Vedic texts present nothing inconsistent with this rule, but in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as 3d pl. forms in <tt>ire</tt> are made after light syllables also: thus, <tt>sas\u1e5bjire, bubudhire, yuyujire, rurudhire</tt>.\n\nb. In roots ending with a vowel, the early usage is more nearly like the later. Thus: for roots in <tt>\u0101</tt> the rule is the same (except that no 2d sing. in <tt>itha</tt> is met with), as <tt>dadhim\u00e1, dadhi\u1e63\u00e9, dadhidhv\u00e9, dadhir\u00e9</tt> (the only persons with <tt>i</tt> quotable from RV. and AV.; and RV. has <tt>dadhre</tt> twice); \u2014 roots in <tt>\u1e5b</tt> appear also to follow the later rule: as <tt>cak\u1e5b\u1e63\u00e9, pap\u1e5b\u1e63e, vav\u1e5b\u1e63\u00e9, vav\u1e5bm\u00e1he</tt>, but <tt>dadhri\u1e63e</tt> and <tt>jabhri\u1e63e</tt>, and in 3d pl. mid. both <tt>cakrir\u00e9</tt> and <tt>dadhrire</tt>; \u2014 \u221a<tt>bh\u016b</tt> has both <tt>babh\u016b\u0301tha</tt> (usually) and <tt>babh\u016b\u0301vitha</tt>, but only <tt>babh\u016bvim\u00e1</tt> (AV.). But there are found, against the later rules, <tt>su\u1e63uma</tt>, <tt>cicyu\u1e63e</tt>, <tt>juhur\u00e9</tt>, and <tt>juh\u016br\u00e9</tt>, without <tt>i</tt>: the instances are too few to found a rule upon.\n\n799. The ending <tt>rir\u00e9</tt> of 3d pl. mid. is found in RV. in six forms: namely, <tt>cikitrire, jag\u1e5bbhrir\u00e9, dadrire, bubhujrir\u00e9, vividrire, sas\u1e5bjrire</tt>; to which SV. adds <tt>duduhrire</tt>, and TB. <tt>dad\u1e5b\u00e7rire</tt>. \n\n800. Examples of inflection. By way of illustration of the rules given above may be given in full the perfect indicative inflection of the following verbs: \n\na. As example of the normal inflection of a root with final consonant, we take the root \u092c\u0941\u0927\u094d <tt>budh</tt> ''know'': its strong form of perfect-stem is \u092c\u0941\u092c\u094b\u0927\u094d <tt>bub\u00f3dh</tt>; weak form, \u092c\u0941\u092c\u0941\u0927\u094d <tt>bubudh</tt>.\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\" \n|\n!colspan=3|active. \n!colspan=3|middle. \n|-\n! ||s.|| d.|| p.|| s.|| d.|| p. \n|-\n|1|| \u092c\u0941\u092c\u094b\u0927<br><tt>bub\u00f3dha</tt> || \u092c\u0941\u092c\u0941\u0927\u093f\u0935<br><tt>bubudhiv\u00e1</tt> || \u092c\u0941\u092c\u0941\u0927\u093f\u092e<br>-<tt>dhim\u00e1</tt> || \u092c\u0941\u092c\u0941\u0927\u0947<br><tt>bubudh\u00e9</tt> || \u092c\u0941\u092c\u0941\u0927\u093f\u0935\u0939\u0947<br>-<tt>dhiv\u00e1he</tt> || \u092c\u0941\u092c\u0941\u0927\u093f\u092e\u0939\u0947<br>-<tt>dhim\u00e1he</tt><noinclude>\n|}</noinclude><noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"412897":{"pageid":412897,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/328","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Cs\u00f6rf\u00f6ly D\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>with, as required by the analogy of the tense with an imperfect of the root-class, <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening in the three persons of the singular. \n\na.

Further, from a few roots with medial (or initial) vowel capable of <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening and having in general that strengthening only in the singular. \n\na. Thus, <tt>\u00e1bhedam</tt> and <tt>abhet</tt> from \u221a<tt>bhid</tt>; <tt>\u00e1mok</tt> from \u221a<tt>muc</tt>; <tt>yojam</tt> from \u221a<tt>yuj</tt>; <tt>rok</tt> (VS.) from \u221a<tt>ruj</tt>; <tt>arodham</tt> and <tt>arudhma</tt> from \u221a<tt>rudh</tt>; <tt>avart</tt> from \u221a<tt>v\u1e5bt</tt>; <tt>v\u00e1rk</tt> from \u221a<tt>v\u1e5bj</tt> (AV. has once <tt>av\u1e5bk</tt>); <tt>adar\u00e7am</tt> from \u221a<tt>d\u1e5b\u00e7</tt>, <tt>\u0101\u0301rdhma</tt> from \u221a<tt>\u1e5bdh</tt>; and <tt>ad\u1e5b\u00e7an</tt>, <tt>av\u1e5bjan</tt>, <tt>a\u00e7vitan</tt>.

Again, from a larger number of roots with <tt>a</tt> as radical vowel: \n\na. Of these, <tt>gam</tt> (with <tt>n</tt> for <tt>m</tt> when final or followed by <tt>m</tt>: 143 a, 212 a) is of decidedly most frequent occurrence, and shows the greatest variety of forms: thus, <tt>\u00e1gamam</tt>, <tt>\u00e1gan</tt> (2d and 3d sing.), <tt>\u00e1ganma</tt>, <tt>aganta</tt> (strong form), <tt>\u00e1gman</tt>. The other cases are <tt>akran</tt> from \u221a<tt>kram</tt>; <tt>\u00e1tan</tt> from \u221a<tt>tan</tt>; <tt>abhr\u0101\u1e6d</tt> from \u221a<tt>bhr\u0101j</tt>; <tt>askan</tt> from \u221a<tt>skand</tt>; <tt>asrat</tt> from \u221a<tt>sra\u1e45s</tt> (?

So far only active forms have been considered. In the middle, a considerable part of the forms are such as are held by the grammarians (881) to belong to the <tt>s</tt>-aorist, with omission of the <tt>s</tt>: they doubtless belong, however, mostly or altogether, here. Thus: \n\na. From roots ending in vowels, we have <tt>adhith\u0101s, adhita</tt> (also <tt>ahita</tt>), and <tt>adh\u012bmahi; adith\u0101s, adita</tt>, and <tt>adimahi</tt> (and <tt>ad\u012bmahi</tt> from \u221a<tt>d\u0101</tt> ''cut''); <tt>\u00e1\u00e7\u012bta</tt> (?); <tt>s\u012bm\u00e1hi; \u00e1sthith\u0101s</tt> and <tt>\u00e1sthita</tt> and <tt>\u00e1sthiran</tt>, forms of <tt>\u0101</tt>-roots; \u2014 of <tt>\u1e5b</tt>-roots, <tt>akri, \u00e1k\u1e5bth\u0101s, \u00e1k\u1e5bta, akr\u0101t\u0101m, \u00e1krata</tt> (and the anomalous <tt>kr\u00e1nta</tt>); <tt>avri, av\u1e5bth\u0101s, av\u1e5bta; \u0101rta, \u0101rata; m\u1e5bth\u0101s, am\u1e5bta; dh\u1e5bth\u0101s; ad\u1e5bth\u0101s; ast\u1e5bta; ah\u1e5bth\u0101s; g\u016brta</tt>; \u2014 of <tt>i</tt> and <tt>u</tt> roots, the only examples are <tt>ahvi</tt> (? AV., once), <tt>\u00e1h\u016bmahi</tt>, and <tt>\u00e1cidhvam</tt>. The absence of any analogies whatever for the omission of a <tt>s</tt> in such forms, and the occurrence of <tt>avri</tt> and <tt>akri</tt> and <tt>\u00e1krata</tt>, show that their reference to the <tt>s</tt>-aorist is probably without sufficient reason. \n\nb. As regards roots ending in consonants, the case is more questionable, since loss of <tt>s</tt> after a final consonant before <tt>th\u0101s</tt> and <tt>ta</tt> (and, of<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"412898":{"pageid":412898,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/327","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Yann\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><tt>astar\u012bs</tt> from \u221a<tt>st\u1e5b</tt>.

The ending <tt>ran</tt> is especially frequent in 3d pl., being taken by a number of verbs which have no other middle person of this aorist: thus, <tt>ag\u1e5bbhran, \u00e1s\u1e5bgran, ad\u1e5b\u00e7ran, abudhran, \u00e1v\u1e5btran, aju\u1e63ran, ak\u1e5bpran, asp\u1e5bdhran, avasran, \u00e1vi\u00e7ran</tt>; and <tt>ram</tt> is found beside <tt>ran</tt> in <tt>\u00e1d\u1e5b\u00e7ram, \u00e1budhram, \u00e1s\u1e5bgram</tt>. \n\nc. From roots of which the final would combine with <tt>s</tt> to <tt>k\u1e63</tt>, it seems more probable that aorist-forms showing <tt>k</tt> (instead of <tt>\u1e63</tt>) before the ending belong to the root-aorist: such are <tt>amukth\u0101s</tt> (and <tt>\u00e1mugdhvam</tt>), <tt>ap\u1e5bkth\u0101s</tt> and <tt>ap\u1e5bkta, \u00e1bhakta, av\u1e5bkta, asakth\u0101s</tt> and <tt>asakta, rikth\u0101s, vikth\u0101s</tt> and <tt>vikta, arukta; apra\u1e63\u1e6da, aya\u1e63\u1e6da, \u00e1spa\u1e63\u1e6da, as\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101s</tt> and <tt>\u00e1s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da</tt>, and <tt>m\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101s</tt> would be the same in either case. \n\nd. There remain, as cases of more doubtful belonging, and probably to be ranked in part with the one formation and in part with the other, according to their period and to the occurrence of other persons: <tt>chitth\u0101s, nutth\u0101\u0301s</tt> and <tt>\u00e1nutta</tt> and <tt>\u00e1nuddhvam, patth\u0101s, bhitth\u0101s, amatta, atapth\u0101s, alipta, as\u1e5bpta</tt>; and finally, <tt>\u00e1rabdha, alabdha, aruddha, abuddha, ayuddha</tt>, and <tt>drogdh\u0101s</tt> (MBh.: read <tt>drugdh\u0101s</tt>): see 883. \n\n<center>Modes of the Root-aorist.</center> \n\n835.

Optative. The optative active of this aorist constitutes, with a <tt>s</tt> interposed between mode-sign and personal endings (567), the precative active of the Hindu grammarians, and is allowed by them to be made from every verb, they recognizing no connection between it and the aorist. But in the 2d sing. the interposed <tt>s</tt> is not distinguishable from the personal ending; and, after the earliest period (see 838), the ending crowds out the sibilant in the 3d sing., which thus comes to end in <tt>y\u0101t</tt> instead of <tt>y\u0101s</tt> (compare 555 a). \n\na. In the older language, however, pure optative forms, without the <tt>s</tt>, are made from this tense. From roots in <tt>\u0101</tt> occur (with change of <tt>\u0101</tt> to <tt>e</tt> before the <tt>y</tt>: 250 d) <tt>dey\u0101m, dhey\u0101m</tt> and <tt>dheyus</tt>, and <tt>sthey\u0101ma</tt>; in <tt>u</tt>-vowels, <tt>bh\u016by\u0101\u0301ma</tt>; in <tt>\u1e5b</tt>, <tt>kriy\u0101ma</tt>; in consonants, <tt>a\u00e7y\u0101\u0301m</tt> and <tt>a\u00e7y\u0101\u0301ma</tt> and <tt>a\u00e7yus</tt>, <tt>v\u1e5bjy\u0101m</tt>, <tt>\u00e7aky\u0101m</tt>, <tt>yujy\u0101va</tt> and <tt>yujy\u0101\u0301t\u0101m</tt>, <tt>s\u0101hy\u0101ma</tt>, and <tt>t\u1e5bdyus</tt>. \n\nb. The optative middle of the root-aorist is not recognized by the Hindu grammarians as making a part of the precative formation. The RV. has, however, two precative forms of it, namely <tt>pad\u012b\u1e63\u1e6d\u00e1</tt> and <tt>muc\u012b\u1e63\u1e6da</tt>. Much more common in the older language are pure optative forms: namely, <tt>a\u00e7\u012bya</tt> and <tt>a\u00e7\u012bm\u00e1hi</tt> (this optative is especially common), <tt>indh\u012bya, gm\u012bya, mur\u012bya, ruc\u012bya; ar\u012bta, uh\u012bta, vur\u012bta; idh\u012bmahi, na\u00e7\u012bmahi, nas\u012bmahi, p\u1e5bc\u012bmahi, mud\u012bmahi, yam\u012bmahi</tt>; and probably, from <tt>\u0101</tt>-roots, <tt>s\u012bm\u00e1hi</tt> and <tt>dh\u012bmahi</tt> (which might also be augmentless indicative, since <tt>adh\u012bmahi</tt> and <tt>adh\u012bt\u0101m</tt> also occur). All these forms except the three in 3d sing. might be precative according to the general understanding of that mode, as being of persons which even by the native authorities are not claimed ever to exhibit the inserted sibilant.\n\n838. Precative active forms of this aorist are made from the earliest period of the language. In RV., they do not occur from any root which has not also other aorist forms of the same class to show. The RV. forms are: 1st sing., <tt>bh\u016by\u0101sam</tt>; 2d sing., <tt>avy\u0101s, j\u00f1ey\u0101s, bh\u016by\u0101\u0301s, m\u1e5bdhy\u0101s, sahy\u0101s</tt>; 3d sing. (in -<tt>y\u0101s</tt>, for -<tt>y\u0101st</tt>; RV. has no 3d sing, in <tt>y\u0101t</tt>, which is later the universal ending), <tt>avy\u0101s, a\u00e7y\u0101s, \u1e5bdhy\u0101s, gamy\u0101\u0301s, daghy\u0101s, pey\u0101s, bh\u016by\u0101\u0301s, yamy\u0101s, y\u016by\u0101s, v\u1e5bjy\u0101s, \u00e7r\u016by\u0101s, sahy\u0101s</tt>; 1st pl., <tt>kriy\u0101sma</tt> (beside <tt>kriy\u0101ma</tt>: 837 a). AV. has six 1st persons sing, in -<tt>y\u0101\u0301sam</tt>, one 2d in -<tt>y\u0101\u0301s</tt>, one 3d in -<tt>y\u0101t</tt> (and one in -<tt>y\u0101s</tt>, in a RV. passage), three 1st pl. in -<tt>y\u0101\u0301sma</tt> (beside one in <tt>y\u0101ma</tt>, in a RV. passage), and the 2d <tt>bh\u016by\u0101stha</tt> (doubtless a false reading: TB. has -<tt>sta</tt> in the corresponding passage).

All together, active optative or precative forms are made in the older language from over fifty roots; and the epic and classical texts add them from hardly a dozen more: see further 925.\n\n839. Imperative. Imperative forms of the root-aorist are not rare in the early language. In the middle, indeed, almost only the 2d sing. occurs: it is accented either regularly, on the ending, as <tt>k\u1e5b\u1e63v\u00e1, dhi\u1e63v\u00e1, yuk\u1e63v\u00e1</tt>, or on the root, as <tt>m\u00e1tsva, y\u00e1k\u1e63va, v\u00e1\u1e45sva, r\u0101\u0301sva, s\u00e1k\u1e63va</tt>; <tt>d\u012b\u1e63va</tt> and <tt>m\u0101sva</tt> are not found with accent; the 2d pl. is represented by <tt>k\u1e5bdhvam, vo\u1e0dhvam</tt>. In the active, all the persons (2d and 3d) are found in use; examples are: 2d sing., <tt>k\u1e5bdh\u00ed, v\u1e5bdhi, \u00e7agdh\u00ed, \u00e7rudh\u00ed, gadhi, ya\u1e41dh\u00ed, gahi, m\u0101hi, s\u0101hi, mogdhi</tt>; 3d sing., <tt>ga\u1e41tu, d\u0101tu, a\u1e63\u1e6du, \u00e7r\u00f3tu, s\u00f3tu</tt>; 2d du., <tt>d\u0101tam, jitam, \u00e7aktam, \u00e7rut\u00e1m, bh\u016bt\u00e1m, sp\u1e5bt\u00e1m, gat\u00e1m, rikt\u00e1m, vo\u1e0dham, sitam, sut\u00e1m</tt>; 3d du., only <tt>ga\u1e41t\u0101m, d\u0101t\u0101m, vo\u1e0dh\u0101\u0301m</tt>; 2d pl., <tt>g\u0101t\u00e1, bh\u016bt\u00e1, \u00e7ruta, k\u1e5bta, gata, d\u0101ta, dh\u0101tana</tt>; 3d pl., only <tt>dh\u0101ntu, \u00e7ruvantu</tt>. These are the most regular forms; but irregularities as to both accent and strengthening are not infrequent. Thus, strong forms in 2d du. and pl. are <tt>ya\u1e41t\u00e1m, varktam, vartam; k\u00e1rta, g\u00e1\u1e41ta</tt> (once <tt>g\u00e1\u1e41t\u00e1</tt>), <tt>ya\u1e41ta, vartta, heta, \u00e7r\u00f3ta, s\u00f3ta</tt>; and, with <tt>tana, k\u00e1rtana, g\u00e1\u1e41tana, ya\u1e41tana, sotana</tt>, and the irregular <tt>dhetana</tt> (\u221a<tt>dh\u0101</tt>); in 3d du., <tt>g\u0101\u1e41t\u0101m</tt>. Much more irregular are <tt>y\u00f3dhi</tt> (instead of <tt>yuddh\u00ed</tt>) from \u221a<tt>yudh</tt>, and <tt>bodh\u00ed</tt> from both \u221a<tt>budh</tt> and \u221a<tt>bh\u016b</tt> (instead of <tt>buddh\u00ed</tt> and <tt>bh\u016bdh\u00ed</tt>). A single form (3d sing.) in <tt>t\u0101t</tt> is found, namely <tt>\u00e7ast\u0101t</tt>. We find <tt>k\u1e5bdhi</tt> also later (MBh. BhP.). \n\na. As to 2d persons singular in <tt>si</tt> from the simple root used in an imperative sense, see above, 624. \n\n<center>Participles of the Root-aorist.</center> \n\n840. In the oldest language, of the RV., are found a number of participles which must be reckoned as belonging to this formation. \n\na. In the active, they are extremely few: namely, <tt>kr\u00e1nt, cit\u00e1nt</tt> (?), <tt>gm\u00e1nt, sth\u0101\u0301nt, bhid\u00e1nt, v\u1e5bdh\u00e1nt, dyutant</tt>- (only in composition), and probably <tt>\u1e5bdh\u00e1nt</tt>. And BhP. has <tt>m\u1e5b\u1e63ant</tt> (but probably by error, for <tt>m\u1e5b\u1e63yant</tt>). \n\nb. In the middle, they are in RV. much more numerous. The accent is usually on the final of the stem: thus, <tt>ar\u0101\u1e47\u00e1, idh\u0101\u1e47\u00e1, kr\u0101\u1e47\u00e1, ju\u1e63\u0101\u1e47\u00e1, t\u1e5b\u1e63\u0101\u1e47\u00e1, nid\u0101n\u00e1, pi\u00e7\u0101n\u00e1, p\u1e5bc\u0101n\u00e1, prath\u0101n\u00e1, budh\u0101n\u00e1, bhiy\u0101n\u00e1, man\u0101n\u00e1, mand\u0101n\u00e1, yuj\u0101n\u00e1, ruc\u0101n\u00e1, vip\u0101n\u00e1, vr\u0101\u1e47\u00e1, ur\u0101\u1e47\u00e1, \u00e7ubh\u0101n\u00e1, sac\u0101n\u00e1, suv\u0101n\u00e1</tt> or <tt>sv\u0101n\u00e1, s\u1e5bj\u0101n\u00e1, sp\u1e5bdh\u0101n\u00e1, hiy\u0101n\u00e1</tt>; \u2014 but sometimes on the root-syllable: thus, <tt>c\u00edt\u0101na, cy\u00e1v\u0101na, r\u00fah\u0101\u1e47a, \u00fah\u0101na</tt> (pres.?), <tt>v\u00e1s\u0101na, \u00e7\u00fambh\u0101na</tt>; \u2014 while a few show both accentuations<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"412902":{"pageid":412902,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/332","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>(compare 619 d): thus, <tt>d\u1e5b\u00e7\u0101n\u00e1</tt> and <tt>d\u1e5b\u0301\u00e7\u0101na</tt>, <tt>dyut\u0101n\u00e1</tt> and <tt>dy\u00fat\u0101na</tt>, <tt>yat\u0101n\u00e1</tt> and <tt>y\u00e1t\u0101na</tt>; and <tt>cet\u0101na</tt> and <tt>hray\u0101\u1e47a</tt> occur only in composition.

All together, the roots exhibiting in the older language forms which are with fair probability to be reckoned to the root-aorist-system are about a hundred and thirty; over eighty of them make such forms in the RV. \n\n<center>Passive Aorist third person singular.</center> \n\n842. A middle third person singular, of peculiar formation and prevailingly passive meaning, is made from many verbs in the older language, and has become a regular part of the passive conjugation, being, according to the grammarians, to be substituted always for the proper third person of any aorist middle that is used in a passive sense.\n\n843. This person is formed by adding \u0907 <tt>i</tt> to the root, which takes also the augment, and is usually strengthened. \n\na. The ending <tt>i</tt> belongs elsewhere only to the first person; and this third person apparently stands in the same relation to a first in <tt>i</tt> as do, in the middle voice, the regular 3d sing. perfect, and also the frequent Vedic 3d sing. present of the root-class (613), which are identical in form with their respective first persons. That a fuller ending has been lost off is extremely improbable; and hence, as an aorist formation from the simple root, this is most properly treated here, in connection with the ordinary root-aorist. \n\n844. Before the ending \u0907 <tt>i</tt>, a final vowel, and usually also a medial \u0905 <tt>a</tt> before a single consonant, have the <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt>-strengthening; other medial vowels have the <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening if capable of it (240); after final \u0906 <tt>\u0101</tt> is added \u092f\u094d <tt>y</tt>. \n\na. Examples (all of them quotable from the older language) are: from roots ending in <tt>\u0101, \u00e1j\u00f1\u0101yi, \u00e1dh\u0101yi, \u00e1p\u0101yi</tt>; in other vowels, <tt>\u00e1\u00e7r\u0101yi, \u00e1st\u0101vi, \u00e1h\u0101vi, \u00e1k\u0101ri, \u00e1st\u0101ri</tt>; \u2014 from roots with medial <tt>i, u, \u1e5b, aceti, \u00e1cchedi, a\u00e7e\u1e63i, \u00e1bodhi, \u00e1moci, \u00e1yoji, \u00e1dar\u00e7i, asarji, varhi</tt>; from roots with medial <tt>a</tt> strengthened, <tt>ag\u0101mi, \u00e1p\u0101di, ay\u0101mi, av\u0101ci, v\u0101pi, \u00e1s\u0101di</tt> (these are all the earlier cases); with <tt>a</tt> unchanged, only <tt>\u00e1jani</tt> (and RV. has once <tt>j\u0101\u0301ni</tt>), and, in heavy syllables, <tt>\u00e1myak\u1e63i, vandi, \u00e7a\u1e45si, syandi</tt>; with medial <tt>\u0101, \u00e1bhr\u0101ji, \u00e1r\u0101dhi</tt>; \u2014 from roots with initial vowel, <tt>\u0101rdhi</tt> (only case). \n\nb.

The <tt>a</tt>-aorist makes in the RV. a small figure beside the root-aorist, being represented by less than half the latter's number of roots. It becomes, however, more common later (it is the only form of aorist which is made from more verbs in AV. than in RV.); and in Veda and Br\u0101hma\u1e47a together about eighty roots exhibit the formation more or less fully. Of these a large number (fully half) are of the type of the roots which make their present-system according to the <tt>\u00e1</tt>-class, having a vowel capable of <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening before a final consonant (754): thus, with <tt>i, chid, bhid, nij, ric, ri\u1e63, lip, vid</tt>, 1 <tt>\u00e7i\u1e63</tt> (<tt>\u00e7\u0101s</tt>), 2 <tt>\u00e7i\u1e63, \u00e7ri\u1e63, \u00e7li\u1e63, sic, sridh</tt>; \u2014 with <tt>u, krudh, k\u1e63udh, guh, du\u1e63, dyut, druh, pu\u1e63, budh, bhuj, muc, mruc, yuj, ruc, rud, rudh, muh, ruh, \u00e7uc</tt>; \u2014 with <tt>\u1e5b, \u1e5bdh, k\u1e5bt, g\u1e5bdh, g\u1e5bh, t\u1e5bp, t\u1e5b\u1e63, t\u1e5bh, d\u1e5bp, d\u1e5b\u00e7, dh\u1e5b\u1e63, n\u1e5bt, m\u1e5bdh, m\u1e5b\u1e63, v\u1e5bt, v\u1e5bdh, v\u1e5b\u1e63, s\u1e5bp, h\u1e5b\u1e63</tt>. A small number end in vowels: thus, <tt>\u1e5b, k\u1e5b, s\u1e5b</tt> (which have the <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>-strengthening throughout), <tt>hi</tt> (? <tt>ahyat</tt> once in AV.), and several in <tt>\u0101</tt>, apparent transfers from the root-class by the weakening of their <tt>\u0101</tt> to <tt>a</tt>: thus, <tt>khy\u0101, hv\u0101, vy\u0101, \u00e7v\u0101</tt>, and <tt>d\u0101</tt> and <tt>dh\u0101</tt>; and <tt>\u0101sthat</tt>, regarded by the grammarians as aorist to \u221a<tt>as</tt> ''throw'', is doubtless a like formation from \u221a<tt>sth\u0101</tt>. A few have a penultimate nasal in the present and elsewhere, which in this aorist is lost: thus, <tt>bhra\u1e45\u00e7, ta\u1e45s, dhva\u1e45s, sra\u1e45s, krand, randh</tt>. Of less classifiable character are <tt>a\u00e7, kram, gam, ghas, tam, \u00e7am, \u00e7ram, tan, san, sad, \u0101p, das, yas, \u00e7ak, dagh</tt>. The roots <tt>pat, na\u00e7, vac</tt> form the tense-stems <tt>papta, ne\u00e7a, voca</tt>, of which the first is palpably and the other two are probably the result of reduplication; but the language has lost the sense of their being such, and makes other reduplicated aorists from the same roots (see below, 854). \n\na. Many of these aorists are simply transfers of the root-aorist to an <tt>a</tt>-inflection. Conspicuous examples are <tt>akarat</tt> etc. and <tt>agamat</tt> etc. (in the earliest period only <tt>akar</tt> and <tt>agan</tt>). \n\n848. The inflection of this aorist is in general so regular that it will be sufficient to give only examples of its Vedic forms. We may take as model <tt>avidam</tt>, from \u221a<tt>vid</tt> ''find'', of which the various persons and modes are more frequent and in fuller variety than those of any other verb. Only the forms actually quotable are instanced; those of which the examples found are from other verbs than vid are bracketed.

A single middle precative form occurs, namely <tt>vide\u1e63\u1e6da</tt> (AV., once); it is so isolated that how much may be inferred from it is very questionable. \n\n851. A complete series of active imperative forms are made from \u221a<tt>sad</tt> (including <tt>sadatana</tt>, 2d pl.), and the middle <tt>sadant\u0101m</tt>. Other imperatives are very rare: namely, <tt>s\u00e1na, s\u00e1ra, ruha, vid\u00e1; ruh\u00e1tam, vid\u00e1tam; khy\u00e1ta</tt>.

The long vowel of the reduplication (786) appears in the participle as in the indicative: thus, <tt>v\u0101v\u1e5bdhv\u0101\u0301\u1e45s, s\u0101sahv\u0101\u0301\u1e45s, j\u016bjuv\u0101\u0301\u1e45s</tt>.

RV. makes the participial forms of \u221a<tt>t\u1e5b</tt> or <tt>tar</tt> from different modifications of the root: thus, <tt>titirv\u0101\u0301\u1e45s</tt>, but <tt>tatar\u00fa\u1e63as</tt>. Respecting the occasional exchanges of strong and weak stem in inflection, see above, 462 c. \n\n805. a.

In the Veda, the long reduplicating vowel is shown by many middle participles: thus, <tt>v\u0101v\u1e5bdh\u0101n\u00e1, v\u0101vas\u0101n\u00e1, d\u0101d\u1e5bh\u0101\u1e47\u00e1, t\u016btuj\u0101n\u00e1</tt>, etc. RV. has <tt>\u00e7a\u00e7ay\u0101n\u00e1</tt> from \u221a<tt>\u00e7\u012b</tt> (with irregular <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt>, as in the present-system: 629); <tt>tistir\u0101\u1e47\u00e1</tt> from \u221a<tt>st\u1e5b</tt>; and once, with <tt>m\u0101na</tt>, <tt>sas\u1e5bm\u0101\u1e47\u00e1</tt> from \u221a<tt>s\u1e5b</tt>. A few participles with long redupl. vowel have it irregularly accented (as if rather intensive: 1013): thus, <tt>t\u016b\u0301tuj\u0101na</tt> (also <tt>t\u016btuj\u0101n\u00e1</tt>), <tt>b\u0101\u0301badh\u0101na, \u00e7\u0101\u0301\u00e7ad\u0101na, \u00e7\u016b\u0301\u00e7uj\u0101na, \u00e7\u016b\u0301\u00e7uv\u0101na</tt>. \n\n807. In the later language, the perfect participles have nearly gone out of use; even the active appears but rarely, and is made from very few verbs, and of the middle hardly any examples are quotable, save such as the proper name <tt>yuyudh\u0101na</tt>, the adjective <tt>an\u016bc\u0101na</tt> ''learned in scripture'', etc.\n\n<center>Modes of the Perfect.</center> \n\n808. Modes of the perfect belong only to the Vedic language, and even are seldom found outside of the Rig-Veda. \n\na. To draw the line surely and distinctly between these and the mode-forms from other reduplicated tense-stems \u2014 the present-stem of the reduplicating class, the reduplicated aorist, and the intensive \u2014 is not possible, since no criterion of form exists which does not in some cases fail, and since the general equivalence of modal forms from all stems (582), and the common use of the perfect as a present in the Veda (823), deprive us of a criterion of meaning. There can be no reasonable doubt, however, that a considerable body of forms are to be reckoned here; optatives like <tt>\u0101na\u00e7y\u0101m</tt> and <tt>babh\u016by\u0101s</tt> and <tt>babh\u016by\u0101\u0301t</tt>, imperatives like <tt>babh\u016btu</tt>, subjunctives like <tt>jabh\u00e1rat</tt>, show such distinctive characteristics of the perfect formation that by their analogy other similar words are confidently classed as belonging to the perfect.\n\n809. The normal method of making such forms would appear to be as follows: from a reduplicated perfect-stem, as (for example) <tt>mumuc</tt>, an imperative would be made by simply appending, as usual, the imperative endings; the derived subjunctive mode-stem would be <tt>mum\u00f3ca</tt> (accented after the analogy of the strong forms<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"413151":{"pageid":413151,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/321","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Ubufox\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>of the perfect indicative), and would take either primary or secondary endings; and the optative mode-stems would be <tt>mumucy\u0101\u0301</tt> in the active, and <tt>mumuc\u012b</tt> (accent on personal endings) in the middle.\n\nAnd the great majority of the forms in question (about three quarters) are made in these ways. Thus: \n\n810. Examples of the regular subjunctive formation are: \n\na. with secondary endings, active: 2d sing., <tt>papr\u00e1thas, c\u0101k\u00e1nas, m\u0101m\u00e1has, pipr\u00e1yas, bubodhas, r\u0101r\u00e1\u1e47as</tt>; 3d sing., <tt>c\u0101k\u00e1nat, jabh\u00e1rat, r\u0101r\u00e1\u1e47at, s\u0101s\u00e1hat, pasp\u00e1r\u00e7at, pipr\u00e1yat</tt>; 1st pl., <tt>c\u0101k\u00e1n\u0101ma, tat\u00e1n\u0101ma, \u00e7\u016b\u00e7\u00e1v\u0101ma</tt>; 3d pl., <tt>tat\u00e1nan, papr\u00e1than</tt> (other persons do not occur). This is the largest class of cases. \n\nb. with primary endings, active: here seem to belong only <tt>dadh\u00e1r\u1e63ati</tt> and <tt>vav\u00e1rtati</tt>: compare the formation with different accent below, 811 a. \n\nc. of middle forms occur only the 3d sing., <tt>tat\u00e1pate, \u00e7a\u00e7\u00e1mate, yuy\u00f3jate, juj\u00f3\u1e63ate</tt> (SV.; RV. has <tt>j\u00fajo\u1e63ate<tt/>); and the 3d pl. <tt>c\u0101k\u00e1nanta, tat\u00e1nanta</tt> (and perhaps two or three others: below, 811 b, end).\n\n811. But not a few subjunctives of other formation occur; thus: \n\na. With strengthened root-syllable, as above, but with accent on the reduplication (as in the majority of present-forms of the reduplicating class: above, 645). Here the forms with primary endings, active, preponderate, and are not very rare: for example, <tt>j\u00fajo\u1e63asi, j\u00fajo\u1e63ati, j\u00fajo\u1e63athas, j\u00fajo\u1e63atha</tt> (other persons do not occur). With secondary endings, <tt>j\u00fajo\u1e63as, j\u00fajo\u1e63at</tt>, and <tt>j\u00fajo\u1e63an</tt> are the forms that belong most distinctly here (since <tt>d\u00e1d\u0101\u00e7as</tt> and <tt>s\u00fa\u1e63\u016bdas</tt> etc. are perhaps rather aorists). And there is no middle form but <tt>j\u00fajo\u1e63ate</tt> (RV.: see above, 810 c).\n\nb. With unstrengthened root-syllable occur a small body of forms, which are apparently also accented on the reduplication (accented examples are found only in 3d pl. mid.): thus, active, for example, <tt>mumucas; vav\u1e5btat, vividat, \u00e7\u016b\u00e7uvat</tt>; the only middle forms are <tt>dadh\u1e5b\u1e63ate, v\u0101v\u1e5bdhate</tt>, 3d sing.; and <tt>c\u00e1kramanta, d\u00e1dh\u1e5b\u1e63anta, r\u00farucanta</tt> (with <tt>dadabhanta, paprathanta, m\u0101mahanta, juhuranta</tt>, which might also belong elsewhere: 810 c).\n\nc. Accented on the ending are <tt>v\u0101v\u1e5bdh\u00e1nta</tt> and <tt>cak\u1e5bp\u00e1nta</tt> (which are rather to be called augmentless pluperfects).\n\nd. As to forms with double mode-sign, or transfers to an <tt>a</tt>-conjugation, see below, 815. \n\n812. Examples of the regular optative formation are: \n\na. In active: 1st sing., <tt>\u0101na\u00e7y\u0101m, jagamy\u0101m, pap\u1e5bcy\u0101m, riricy\u0101m</tt>; 2d sing., <tt>vav\u1e5bty\u0101s, vivi\u00e7y\u0101s, \u00e7u\u00e7r\u016by\u0101\u0301s, babh\u016by\u0101s</tt>; 3d sing., jagamy\u0101t, vav\u1e5bty\u0101t, tutujy\u0101\u0301t, babh\u016by\u0101\u0301t</tt>; 2d du., <tt>jagmy\u0101tam, \u00e7u\u00e7r\u016by\u0101\u0301tam</tt>; 1st pl., <tt>s\u0101sahy\u0101ma, vav\u1e5bty\u0101ma, \u00e7\u016b\u00e7uy\u0101ma</tt>; 3d pl., <tt>tatanyus, vav\u1e5bjy\u00fas, vav\u1e5btyus</tt>.

There is no irregular mode of formation of perfect optatives. Individual irregularities are shown by certain forms: thus, <tt>cakriy\u0101s, pap\u012by\u0101t, \u00e7u\u00e7r\u016by\u0101\u0301s and \u00e7u\u00e7r\u016by\u0101\u0301tam</tt>, with treatment of the final as before the passive-sign <tt>y\u00e1</tt> (770); <tt>anajy\u0101t</tt> with short initial; <tt>\u00e7i\u00e7r\u012bt\u00e1</tt> from \u221a<tt>\u00e7ri</tt>; <tt>jak\u1e63\u012by\u0101t</tt> is anomalous: <tt>riri\u1e63es</tt> is the only form that shows a union-vowel <tt>a</tt> (unless also <tt>si\u1e63et</tt>, from \u221a<tt>s\u0101</tt>). \n\n813. Of regular imperative forms, only a very small number are to be quoted: namely, active, <tt>c\u0101kandhi, r\u0101randh\u00ed, cikiddhi, titigdhi, mumugdh\u00ed, \u00e7u\u00e7ugdh\u00ed</tt>, and <tt>pipr\u012bh\u00ed</tt>; <tt>c\u0101kantu, r\u0101rantu, mumoktu</tt>, and <tt>babh\u016btu</tt>; <tt>mumuktam</tt> and <tt>vav\u1e5bktam</tt>; <tt>juju\u1e63\u1e6dana</tt> and <tt>vav\u1e5bttana</tt> (unless we are to add <tt>mamaddh\u00ed, mamattu, mam\u00e1ttana</tt>); \u2014 middle, <tt>vav\u1e5btsva</tt> and <tt>vav\u1e5bddhvam</tt>.  AV. has once <tt>dad\u1e5b\u00e7r\u0101m</tt>.\n\n814. As irregular imperatives may be reckoned several which show a union-vowel <tt>a</tt>, or have been transferred to an <tt>a</tt>-conjugation. Such are, in the active, <tt>mum\u00f3catam</tt> and <tt>jujo\u1e63atam</tt> (2d du.), and <tt>mum\u00f3cata</tt> (2d pl.); in the middle, <tt>pipr\u00e1yasva</tt> (only one found with accent), and <tt>m\u0101mahasva, v\u0101v\u1e5bdhasva, v\u0101v\u1e5b\u1e63asva</tt> (2d sing.), and <tt>m\u0101mahant\u0101m</tt> (3d pl.: probably to be accented -<tt>\u00e1sva</tt> and -<tt>\u00e1nt\u0101m</tt>).\n\n815. Such imperatives as these, taken in connection with some of the subjunctives given above (and a few of the \"pluperfect\" forms: below, 820), suggest as plausible the assumption of a double present-stem, with reduplication and added <tt>a</tt> (with which the desiderative stems would be comparable: below, 1026 ff.): for example, <tt>jujo\u1e63a</tt> from \u221a<tt>ju\u1e63</tt>, from which would come <tt>j\u00fajo\u1e63asi</tt> etc. and <tt>j\u00fajo\u1e63ate</tt> (811 a) as indicative, <tt>j\u00fajo\u1e63as</tt> etc. as subjunctively used augmentless imperfect, and <tt>jujo\u1e63atam</tt> as imperative. Most of the forms given above as subjunctives with primary ending lack a marked and constant subjunctive character, and would pass fairly well as indicatives. And it appears tolerably certain that from one root at least, v\u1e5bdh, such a double stem is to be recognized; from <tt>v\u0101v\u1e5bdha</tt> come readily <tt>v\u0101v\u1e5bdhate</tt>, <tt>v\u0101v\u1e5bdh\u00e1nta</tt>, and from it alone can come regularly <tt>v\u0101v\u1e5bdhasva</tt>, <tt>v\u0101v\u1e5bdh\u00e9te</tt> and <tt>v\u0101v\u1e5bdh\u0101ti</tt> (once, RV.) \u2014 and, yet more, the participle <tt>vav\u1e5bdh\u00e1nt</tt> (RV.; AV. <tt>v\u0101v\u1e5bdh\u00e1nt</tt>: an isolated case): yet even here we have also <tt>v\u0101v\u1e5bdh\u012bth\u0101\u0301s</tt>, not <tt>v\u0101v\u1e5bdh\u00e9th\u0101s</tt>. To assume double present-stems, however, in all the cases would be highly implausible; it is better to recognize the formation as one begun, but not carried out. \n\na.

Of an augment-preterit from the perfect-stem, to which the name of pluperfect is given on the ground of its formation (though not of its meaning), the Veda presents a few examples; and one or two forms of the later language (mentioned above, 788 b) have also been referred to it. \n\na. There is much of the same difficulty in distinguishing the pluperfect as the perfect modes from kindred reduplicated formations. Between it and the aorist, however, a difference of meaning helps to make a separation.\n\n818. The normal pluperfect should show a strong stem in the singular active, and a weak one elsewhere \u2014 thus, <tt>mumoc</tt> and <tt>mumuc</tt> \u2014 with augment prefixed and secondary endings added (<tt>us</tt> in 3d pl. act., <tt>ata</tt> in 3d pl. mid.). \n\na. Of forms made according to this model, we have, in the active: 1st sing., <tt>ajagrabham</tt> and <tt>acacak\u1e63am</tt> (which, by its form, might be aorist: 860); 2d sing. <tt>\u00e1jagan</tt>; 3d sing., <tt>ajagan</tt> and <tt>aciket</tt>; 2d du., <tt>amumuktam</tt>; 2d pl. <tt>\u00e1jaganta</tt>, and <tt>\u00e1jagantana</tt> and <tt>ajabhartana</tt> (a strong form, as often in this person: 556 a); 3d pl. (perhaps), <tt>amamandus</tt> and <tt>amamadus</tt>. To these may be added the augmentless <tt>c\u0101k\u00e1n</tt> and <tt>r\u0101r\u00e1n</tt>, <tt>cik\u00e9tam</tt> and <tt>cakaram</tt>. In the middle, the 3d pl. <tt>acakriran</tt> and <tt>ajagmiran</tt> (with <tt>iran</tt> instead of <tt>ata</tt>), and the augmentless 2d sing. <tt>jug\u016brth\u0101s</tt> and <tt>su\u1e63upth\u0101s</tt>, are the most regular forms to be found. \n\n819. Several forms from roots ending in consonants save the endings in 2d and 3d sing. act. by inserting an <tt>\u012b</tt> (555 b): thus, <tt>\u00e1bubhoj\u012bs, avive\u00e7\u012bs; arirec\u012bt, \u00e1jagrabh\u012bt</tt> (<tt>av\u0101var\u012bt</tt> and <tt>av\u0101va\u00e7\u012bt\u0101m</tt> are rather intensives); and the augmentless <tt>j\u00edhi\u1e45s\u012bs</tt> (accent?) and <tt>dadhar\u1e63\u012bt</tt> belong with them.\n\n820. A few forms show a stem ending in a: they are, in the active: 3d sing., <tt>asasvajat, acikitat, acakrat</tt>; in the middle: 3d sing., <tt>\u00e1piprata</tt>; 2d du., <tt>\u00e1pasp\u1e5bdheth\u0101m</tt>; 3d pl., <tt>atitvi\u1e63anta</tt> (which by its form might be aorist), <tt>\u00e1dad\u1e5bhanta</tt>; and <tt>cakradat, cak\u1e5bp\u00e1nta, v\u0101v\u1e5bdh\u00e1nta, juhuranta</tt>, would perhaps be best classified here as augmentless forms (compare 811, above). \n\n<center>Uses of the Perfect.</center> \n\n821. Perfects are quotable as made from more than half the roots of the language, and they abound in use at every period and in almost all branches of the literature, though not always with the same value.\n\na.

In the later language, it is simply a preterit or past tense, equivalent with the imperfect, and freely interchangeable or co\u00f6rdinated with it. It is on the whole less common than the imperfect, although the preferences of different authors are diverse, and it sometimes exceeds the imperfect in frequency (compare (927). \n\nc. The perfects <tt>veda</tt> and <tt>\u0101ha</tt> are everywhere used with present value. In the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, also others, especially <tt>d\u0101dh\u0101ra</tt>, also <tt>d\u012bd\u0101ya</tt>, <tt>bibh\u0101ya</tt>, etc.\n\n822. In the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the distinction of tense-value between perfect and imperfect is almost altogether lost, as in the later language. But in most of the texts the imperfect is the ordinary tense of narration, the perfect being only exceptionally used. Thus in PB., the imperfects are to the perfects as more than a hundred to one; in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a parts of TS. and TB., as over thirty-four to one; and in those of MS. in about the same proportion; in AB., as more than four to one, the perfect appearing mostly in certain passages, where it takes the place of imperfect. It is only in \u00c7B. that the perfect is much more commonly used, and even, to a considerable extent, in co\u00f6rdination with the imperfect. Throughout the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, however, the perfect participles have in general the true \"perfect\" value, indicating a completed or proximate past. \n\n823. In the Veda, the case is very different. The perfect is used as past tense in narration, but only rarely; sometimes also it has a true \"perfect\" sense, or signifies a completed or proximate past (like the aorist of the older language: 928); but oftenest it has a value hardly or not at all distinguishable in point of time from the present. It is thus the equivalent of imperfect, aorist, and present; and it occurs co\u00f6rdinated with them all. \n\na. Examples are: of perfect with present, <tt>n\u00e1 \u00e7r\u0101myanti n\u00e1 v\u00ed mu\u00f1canty \u00e9te v\u00e1yo n\u00e1 paptu\u1e25</tt> (RV.)

In view of such as these, the forms from the stem <tt>bh\u00fava</tt> and <tt>\u00e7r\u00fava</tt> (836 c) are perhaps to be referred hither.

Its characteristic is a reduplication of the radical syllable, by which it is assimilated, on the one hand, to the imperfect of the reduplicating class (656 ff.), and, on the other hand, to the so-called pluperfect (817 ff.). But the aorist reduplication has taken on a quite peculiar character, with few traces left even in the Veda of a different condition which may have preceded this. \n\n858. a. As regards, indeed, the consonant of the reduplication, it follows the general rules already given (590). And the quality of the reduplicated vowel is in general as in the formations already treated: it needs only to be noted that an <tt>a</tt>-vowel and <tt>\u1e5b</tt> (or <tt>ar</tt>) are usually (for exceptions, see below, 860) repeated by an <tt>i</tt>-vowel \u2014 as they are, to a considerable extent, in the reduplicated present also (660). \n\nb. But in regard to quantity, this aorist aims always at establishing a diversity between the reduplicating and radical syllables, making the one heavy and the other light. And the preference is very markedly for a heavy reduplication and a light root-syllable \u2014 which relation is brought about wherever the conditions allow. Thus: \n\n859. If the root is a light syllable (having a short vowel followed by a single consonant), the reduplication is made heavy. \n\na. And this, usually by lengthening the reduplicating vowel, with <tt>\u012b</tt> for radical <tt>a</tt> or <tt>\u1e5b</tt> or <tt>\u1e37</tt>. (in the single root containing that vowel): thus, <tt>ar\u012bri\u1e63am, ad\u016bdu\u1e63am, aj\u012bjanam, av\u012bv\u1e5bdham, ac\u012bk\u1e37pam</tt>. The great majority of reduplicated aorists are of this form. \n\nb.

If the root is a heavy syllable (having a long vowel, or a short before two consonants), the vowel of the reduplication is short: and in this case \u0905 <tt>a</tt> or \u0906 <tt>\u0101</tt>, and \u090b <tt>\u1e5b</tt> (if it occurs), are reduplicated by \u0905 <tt>a</tt>. \n\na.

And, in the cases in which a root should both begin and end with two consonants, both syllables would be necessarily heavy, notwithstanding the short vowel in the former: thus, <tt>apapraccham, acaskandam</tt> (but no such forms are found in use). \n\nb. A medial <tt>\u1e5b</tt> is allowed by the grammarians to retain the strengthening of the causative stem, together with, of course, reduplication by <tt>a</tt>: thus, <tt>acakar\u1e63at, avavartat</tt> (beside <tt>ac\u012bk\u1e5b\u1e63at, av\u012bv\u1e5btat</tt>); but no such forms have been met with in use. \n\nc. These aorists are not distinguishable in form from the so-called pluperfects (817 ff.).\n\n861. a. In order, however, to bring about the favored relation of heavy reduplication and light radical syllable, a heavy root is sometimes made light: either by shortening its vowel, as in <tt>ar\u012bradham</tt> from \u221a<tt>r\u0101dh, av\u012bva\u00e7am</tt> from \u221a<tt>v\u0101\u00e7, as\u012b\u1e63adham</tt> from \u221a<tt>s\u0101dh, aj\u012bjivam</tt> from \u221a<tt>j\u012bv, ad\u012bdipam</tt> (K. and later: BV. has <tt>did\u012bpas</tt>) from \u221a<tt>d\u012bp, ab\u012bbhi\u1e63am</tt> from \u221a<tt>bh\u012b\u1e63, as\u016bsucam</tt> from \u221a<tt>s\u016bc</tt>; or by dropping a penultimate nasal, as in <tt>acikradam</tt> from \u221a<tt>krand, asi\u1e63yadam</tt> from \u221a<tt>syand</tt>. \n\nb. In those cases in which (1047) an aorist is formed directly from a causal stem in <tt>\u0101p</tt>, the <tt>\u0101</tt> is abbreviated to <tt>i</tt>: thus, <tt>ati\u1e63\u1e6dhipam</tt> etc., <tt>ajij\u00f1ipat</tt> (but KSS. <tt>ajij\u00f1apat</tt>), <tt>j\u012bhipas, aj\u012bjipata</tt> (but VS. <tt>aj\u012bjapata</tt>); but from <tt>\u00e7rap</tt> comes <tt>a\u00e7i\u00e7rap\u0101ma</tt> (\u00c7B.). \n\n862. Examples of this aorist from roots with initial vowel are very rare; the older language has only <tt>\u0101mamat</tt> (or <tt>amamat</tt>) from \u221a<tt>am, \u0101pipan</tt> (\u00c7B.: BAU. <tt>\u0101pipipat</tt>) from \u221a<tt>\u0101p</tt>, and <tt>arpipam</tt> (augmentless) from the causative stem <tt>arp</tt> of \u221a<tt>\u1e5b</tt> \u2014 in which latter the root is excessively abbreviated. The grammarians give other similar formations, as <tt>\u0101rcicam</tt> from \u221a<tt>arc, \u0101ubjijam</tt> from \u221a<tt>ubj, \u0101rjiham</tt> from \u221a<tt>arh, \u0101icik\u1e63am</tt> from \u221a<tt>\u012bk\u1e63, \u0101rdidham</tt> from \u221a<tt>\u1e5bdh</tt>.

Of forms analogous with these occur a number from roots in <tt>u</tt> or <tt>\u016b</tt>: thus, <tt>an\u016bnot</tt> and <tt>n\u016bnot</tt> from \u221a<tt>nu</tt>; <tt>y\u016byot</tt> from \u221a<tt>yu</tt> ''separate''; <tt>d\u016bdhot</tt> from \u221a<tt>dh\u016b</tt>; <tt>apupot</tt> from \u221a<tt>p\u016b</tt>; <tt>t\u016btos</tt> and <tt>t\u016btot</tt> from \u221a<tt>tu</tt>; <tt>asu\u1e63ot</tt> from \u221a<tt>s\u016b</tt>; \u2014 and one or two from roots in <tt>i</tt> or <tt>\u012b</tt>: thus, <tt>si\u1e63et</tt> from \u221a<tt>si</tt> (or <tt>s\u0101</tt>) ''bind''; <tt>am\u012bmet</tt> from \u221a<tt>m\u0101</tt> ''bellow''; <tt>apipres</tt> (with <tt>apiprayan</tt>, noticed above) from \u221a<tt>pr\u012b</tt> (and the \"imperfects\" from <tt>d\u012bdh\u012b</tt> etc., 676, are of corresponding form). And from \u221a<tt>cyu</tt> are made, with union-vowel <tt>\u012b</tt>, <tt>acucyav\u012bt</tt> and <tt>acucyav\u012btana</tt>. Few of these forms possess a necessarily causative or a decidedly aoristic value, and it is very doubtful whether they should not be assigned to the perfect-system. \n\nb. From the later language are quotable only <tt>a\u00e7i\u00e7riyat</tt> etc. (3d pl., -<tt>yan</tt> or -<tt>yus</tt>) and <tt>adudruvat</tt>.\n\n<center>Modes of the Reduplicated Aorist.</center>\n\n869. a. As in other preterit formations, the augmentless indicative persons of this aorist are used subjunctively, and they are very much more frequent than true subjunctives.\n\nb. Of the latter are found only <tt>r\u012bradh\u0101</tt> (1st sing.); <tt>t\u012btap\u0101si</tt>; <tt>c\u012bk\u1e37p\u0101ti</tt> and <tt>s\u012b\u1e63adh\u0101ti</tt>, and <tt>pisp\u1e5b\u00e7ati</tt> (as if corresponding to an indicative <tt>apisp\u1e5bk</tt>, like <tt>a\u00e7i\u00e7nat</tt>); and perhaps the 1st sing. mid. <tt>\u00e7a\u00e7vac\u0101\u00ed</tt>. \n\nc. The augmentless indicative forms are accented in general on the reduplication: thus, <tt>d\u012b\u0301dharas, n\u012b\u0301na\u00e7as; j\u012b\u0301janat, p\u012b\u0301parat; j\u012b\u0301janan</tt>; also <tt>s\u00ed\u1e63vap</tt>; but, on the other hand, we have also <tt>p\u012bp\u00e1rat, \u00e7i\u00e7r\u00e1thas</tt> and <tt>\u00e7i\u00e7n\u00e1that</tt>, and <tt>dudr\u00e1vat</tt> and <tt>tu\u1e63\u1e6d\u00e1vat</tt> (which may perhaps belong to the perfect: compare 810). According to the native grammarians, the accent rests either on the radical syllable or on the one that follows it. \n\n870. Optative forms are even rarer. The least questionable case is the middle \"precative\" <tt>r\u012bri\u1e63\u012b\u1e63\u1e6da</tt> (<tt>riri\u1e63\u012b\u1e63\u1e6da</tt> has been ranked above with <tt>s\u0101sah\u012b\u1e63\u1e6da</tt>, as a perfect: 812 b). <tt>Cucyuv\u012bmahi</tt> and <tt>cucyav\u012brata</tt> belong either here or to the perfect-system. \n\n871.

No participle is found belonging to the reduplicated aorist. \n\n873. The number of roots from which this aorist is met with in the earlier language is about a hundred and twenty. In the later Sanskrit it is unusual; in the series of later texts mentioned above (826) it occurs only twice; and it has been found quotable from hardly fifty roots in the whole epic and classical literature. \n\n<center>III. Sigmatic or Sibilant Aorist.</center> \n\n874. a. The common tense-sign of all the varieties of this aorist is a \u0938\u094d <tt>s</tt> (convertible to \u0937\u094d <tt>\u1e63</tt>: 180) which is added to the root in forming the tense-stem. \n\nb. This sibilant has no analogues among the class-signs of the present-system; but it is to be compared with that which appears (and likewise with or without the same union-vowel <tt>i</tt>) in the stems of the future tense-system (932 ff.) and of the desiderative conjugation (1027 ff.). \n\nc. To the root thus increased the augment is prefixed and the secondary endings are added. \n\n875. In the case of a few roots, the sibilant tense-stem (always ending in \u0915\u094d\u0937 <tt>k\u1e63</tt>) is further increased by an \u0905 <tt>a</tt>, and the inflection is nearly like that of an imperfect of the second or <tt>a</tt>- conjugation. \n\n876. a. In the vast majority of cases, the sibilant is the final of the tense-stem, and the inflection is like that of an imperfect of the first or non-<tt>a</tt>-conjugation. \n\nb. And these, again, fall into two nearly equal and strongly marked classes, according as the sibilant is added immediately to the final of the root, or with an auxiliary vowel \u0907 <tt>i</tt>, making the tense-sign \u0907\u0937\u094d <tt>i\u1e63</tt>. Finally, before this \u0907\u0937\u094d <tt>i\u1e63</tt> the root is in a very small number of cases increased by a \u0938\u094d <tt>s</tt>, making the whole addition \u0938\u093f\u0937\u094d <tt>si\u1e63</tt>.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]},"413295":{"pageid":413295,"ns":104,"title":"Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/342","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"proofread-page","*":"<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>877. We have, then, the following classification for the varieties of sibilant-aorist: \n\nA. With endings added directly to the sibilant: \n\n4. with \u0938\u094d <tt>s</tt> simply after the root: <tt>s</tt>-aorist; \n\n5. with \u0907 <tt>i</tt> before the \u0938\u094d <tt>s</tt>: <tt>i\u1e63</tt>-aorist; \n\n6. the same, with \u0938\u094d <tt>s</tt> at end of root: <tt>si\u1e63</tt>-aorist. \n\nB. With \u0905 <tt>a</tt> added to the sibilant before the endings: \n\n7. with sibilant and \u0905 <tt>a</tt>: <tt>sa</tt>-aorist. \n\na. As regards the distinction between the fourth and fifth forms, it may be said in a general way that those roots incline to take the auxiliary <tt>i</tt> in the aorist which take it also in other formations; but it is impossible to lay down any strict rules as to this accordance. Compare 903. \n\n<center>4. The <tt>s</tt>-aorist.</center> \n\n878. The tense-stem of this aorist is made by adding \u0938\u094d <tt>s</tt> to the augmented root, of which also the vowel is usually strengthened. \n\n879. The general rules as to the strengthening of the root-vowel are these: \n\na. A final vowel (including \u090b <tt>\u1e5b</tt>) has the <tt>v\u1e5bddhi</tt>-change in the active, and (excepting \u090b <tt>\u1e5b</tt>) <tt>gu\u1e47a</tt> in the middle: thus, from \u221a\u0928\u0940 ''lead'', active stem \u0905\u0928\u0948\u0937\u094d <tt>an\u0101i\u1e63</tt>, middle stem \u0905\u0928\u0947\u0937\u094d <tt>ane\u1e63</tt>; from \u221a\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0941 <tt>\u00e7ru</tt> ''hear'', \u0905\u0936\u094d\u0930\u094c\u0937\u094d <tt>a\u00e7r\u0101u\u1e63</tt> and \u0905\u0936\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0937\u094d <tt>a\u00e7ro\u1e63</tt>; from \u221a\u0915\u0943 <tt>k\u1e5b</tt> ''make'', \u0905\u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0937 <tt>ak\u0101r\u1e63</tt> and \u0905\u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d <tt>ak\u1e5b\u1e63</tt>.\n\nb.

But before \u0938\u094d <tt>s</tt> and \u0924\u094d <tt>t</tt> of 2d and 3d sing. act. is in the later language always inserted an \u0908 <tt>\u012b</tt>, making the endings \u0908\u0938\u094d <tt>\u012bs</tt> and \u0908\u0924\u094d <tt>\u012bt</tt>.\n\nc. This insertion is unknown in the earliest language (of the BV.): see below, 888.\n\n881. a. Before endings beginning with <tt>t</tt> or <tt>th</tt>, the tense-sign <tt>s</tt> is (233 c\u2013e) omitted after the final consonant of a root \u2014 unless this be <tt>r</tt>, or <tt>n</tt> or <tt>m</tt> (converted to <tt>anusv\u0101ra</tt>). \n\nb. The same omission is of course made before <tt>dhvam</tt> after a consonant; and after a vowel the sibilant is either omitted or assimilated (the equivalence of <tt>dhv</tt> and <tt>ddhv</tt> in the theories of the grammarians and the practice of the manuscripts makes it impossible to say which: 232); and then the ending becomes <tt>\u1e0dhvam</tt>, provided the sibilant, if retained, would have been <tt>\u1e63</tt> (226 c): thus, <tt>asto\u1e0dhvam</tt> and <tt>av\u1e5b\u1e0dhvam</tt> (beside <tt>asto\u1e63ata</tt> and <tt>av\u1e5b\u1e63ata</tt>); <tt>d\u1e5b\u1e0dhvam</tt> (\u221a<tt>d\u1e5b</tt> ''regard'': \u00c7B., once), which is to <tt>d\u1e5bth\u0101s</tt> (2d sing.) as <tt>av\u1e5b\u1e0dhvain</tt> and <tt>av\u1e5b\u1e63ata</tt> to <tt>avri</tt> and <tt>av\u1e5bth\u0101s</tt>; and <tt>k\u1e5b\u1e0dhvam</tt> (M.).\n\nc. According to the grammarians, the omission of <tt>s</tt> before <tt>t</tt> and <tt>th</tt> takes place also after a short vowel (the case can occur only in the 2d and 3d sing, mid.); but we have seen above (834 a) that this is to be viewed rather as a substitution in those persons of the forms of the root-aorist. Neither in the earlier nor in the later language, however, does any example occur of an aorist-form with <tt>s</tt> retained after a short vowel before these endings. \n\nd. After the final sonant aspirate of a root, the sibilant before the same endings is said by the Hindu grammarians to disappear altogether, the combination of the aspirate with the <tt>th</tt> or <tt>t</tt> of the ending being then made according to the ordinary rule for such cases (160): thus, from the stem <tt>ar\u0101uts</tt>, for <tt>ar\u0101udh</tt>-<tt>s</tt>, is made <tt>ar\u0101uddha</tt>, as if from <tt>ar\u0101udh</tt>+<tt>ta</tt> directly. No example of such a form is quotable from the literature; but the combination is established by the occurrence of other similar cases (233 f). In the middle, in like manner, <tt>aruts</tt>+<tt>ta</tt> becomes <tt>aruddha</tt>, as if from <tt>arudh</tt>+<tt>ta</tt>; but all such forms admit also of being understood as of the root-aorist. Those that have been found to occur were given above (834 d); probably they belong at least in part to this aorist.\n\ne. From the three nasal roots <tt>gam, tan, man</tt> are made the 2d and 3d sing. mid. persons <tt>agath\u0101s</tt> and <tt>agata, atath\u0101s</tt> and <tt>atata</tt>, and <tt>amata</tt> (<tt>amath\u0101s</tt> not quotable), reckoned by the native grammarians as <tt>s</tt>-aorist forms, made, after loss of their final root-nasal, with loss also of the sibilant after a short vowel. They are doubtless better referred to the root-aorist. But JB. has a corresponding 1st sing. <tt>atasi</tt> from \u221a<tt>tan</tt>. \n\n882.

Roots ending in changeable <tt>\u1e5b</tt> (so-called roots in <tt>\u1e5d</tt>: 242) are said by the grammarians to convert this vowel to <tt>\u012br</tt> in middle forms: thus, <tt>ast\u012br\u1e63i, ast\u012br\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101s</tt> etc. (from \u221a<tt>st\u1e5b</tt>); of such forms, however, has been found in the older language only <tt>ak\u012br\u1e63ata</tt>, PB. \n\n886. The <tt>s</tt>-aorist is made in the older language from about a hundred and forty roots (in RV., from about seventy; in AV., from about fifty, of which fifteen are additional to those in RV.); and the epic and classical literature adds but a very small number. It has in the Veda certain peculiarities of stem-formation and inflection, and also the full series of modes \u2014 of which the optative middle is retained also later as a part of the \"precative\" (but see 925 b). \n\n887. Irregularities of stem-formation are as follows: \n\na. The strengthening of the root-syllable is now and then irregularly made or omitted: thus, <tt>ayok\u1e63\u012bt</tt> (AB.), <tt>chets\u012bs</tt> (B.S.; also occurs in MBh., which has further <tt>yots\u012bs</tt>), <tt>rots\u012bs</tt> (KU.); <tt>amatsus</tt> (RV.); <tt>ay\u0101\u1e41si</tt> and <tt>ar\u0101utsi</tt> (AB.), <tt>as\u0101k\u1e63i</tt> etc. (V.B.: \u221a<tt>sah</tt>), <tt>m\u0101\u1e45sta</tt> (AY.) and <tt>m\u0101\u1e45st\u0101m</tt> (TA.); <tt>lops\u012bya</tt> (U.); and MBh. has <tt>drogdh\u0101s</tt>. From \u221a<tt>saj</tt> is made <tt>s\u0101n\u0304k\u1e63\u012bt</tt> (U. etc.), and from \u221a<tt>majj</tt>, <tt>am\u0101n\u0304k\u1e63\u012bt</tt> (not quotable). The form <tt>ayun\u0304k\u1e63mahi</tt> (BhP.) is doubtless a false reading. \n\nb. A radical final nasal is lost in <tt>agasmahi</tt> (RV.) and <tt>gas\u0101th\u0101m</tt> (TA.) from \u221a<tt>gam</tt>, and in the optatives <tt>mas\u012bya</tt> and <tt>vas\u012bmahi</tt> (RV.) from \u221a\u221a<tt>man</tt> and <tt>van</tt>. \n\nc.

A few miscellaneous irregularities call still for notice:\n\na. The root <tt>ah</tt> ''speak'' occurs only in the perfect indicative, and only in the 3d persons of all numbers and in the 2d sing. and du., in active (and in 2d sing. the <tt>h</tt> is irregularly changed to <tt>t</tt> before the ending): thus, <tt>\u0101ttha, \u0101\u0301ha; \u0101hathus, \u0101hatus; \u0101h\u00fas</tt> (in V., only <tt>\u0101\u0301ha</tt> and <tt>\u0101h\u00fas</tt> are met with). \n\nb. From \u221a<tt>v\u0101</tt> ''weave'', the 3d pl. act. <tt>\u016bvus</tt> occurs in RV., and no other perfect form appears to have been met with in use. It is allowed by the grammarians to be inflected regularly as <tt>v\u0101</tt>; and also as <tt>vay</tt> (the present-stem is <tt>v\u00e1ya</tt>: 761 f), with contraction of <tt>va</tt> to <tt>u</tt> in weak forms; and further, in the weak forms, as simple <tt>u</tt>. \n\nc. The root <tt>vy\u0101</tt> ''envelop'' has in RV. the perfect-forms <tt>vivyathus</tt> and <tt>vivy\u00e9</tt>, and no others have been met with in use; the grammarians require the strong forms to be made from <tt>vyay</tt>, and the weak from <tt>v\u012b</tt>.\n\nd. The root <tt>i</tt> ''go'' forms in RV. and AV. the 2d sing. act. <tt>iy\u00e1tha</tt> beside the regular <tt>iy\u00e9tha</tt>; and beside <tt>\u012brir\u00e9</tt> from \u221a<tt>\u012br</tt>, RV. has several times <tt>erir\u00e9</tt>. \n\ne.

From roots in <tt>\u0101</tt> are made a few forms of problematic character: namely, <tt>ye\u1e63am</tt> (only case in RV.), <tt>khye\u1e63am, j\u00f1e\u1e63am, ge\u1e63am</tt> and <tt>ge\u1e63ma, de\u1e63ma, se\u1e63am</tt> and <tt>set, sthe\u1e63am</tt> and <tt>sthe\u1e63us</tt>. Their value is optative. The analogy of <tt>je\u1e63am</tt> and <tt>je\u1e63ma</tt> suggests the possibility of their derivation from <tt>i</tt>-forms of the <tt>\u0101</tt>-roots; or the sibilant might be of a precative character (thus, <tt>y\u0101-\u012b-s-am</tt>). That they really belong to the <tt>i\u1e63</tt>-aorist appears highly improbable.\n\nd. The RV. has a few difficult first persons middle in <tt>se</tt>, which are perhaps best noted here. They are: 1. from the simple root, <tt>k\u1e5b\u1e63e, hi\u1e63e</tt> (and <tt>ohi\u1e63e</tt>?), <tt>stu\u1e63\u00e9</tt>; 2. from present-stems, <tt>arcase, \u1e5b\u00f1jase, yajase, g\u0101yi\u1e63e, g\u1e5b\u1e47\u012b\u1e63\u00e9</tt> and <tt>pun\u012b\u1e63\u00e9</tt>. They have the value of indicative present. Compare below, 897 b.\n\n895. Optative forms of this aorist are made in the middle only, and they have in 2d and 3d sing. always the precative <tt>s</tt> before the endings. Those found to occur in the older language are: <tt>di\u1e63\u012bya, dhi\u1e63\u012bya, bhak\u1e63\u012by\u00e1, mas\u012bya</tt> (for <tt>ma\u1e45s\u012bya</tt>), <tt>muk\u1e63\u012bya, r\u0101\u1e63\u012bya, lops\u012bya, s\u0101k\u1e63\u012bya, st\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bya; ma\u1e45s\u012b\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101s; dar\u1e63\u012b\u1e63\u1e6da, bhak\u1e63\u012b\u1e63\u1e6da, ma\u1e45s\u012b\u1e63\u1e6dha, m\u1e5bk\u1e63\u012b\u1e63\u1e6da; bhak\u1e63\u012bmahi, dhuk\u1e63\u012bm\u00e1hi, ma\u1e45s\u012bm\u00e1hi, va\u1e45s\u012bm\u00e1hi, vas\u012bmahi, sak\u1e63\u012bm\u00e1hi; ma\u1e45s\u012brata</tt>. PB. has <tt>bhuk\u1e63i\u1e63\u012bya</tt>, which should belong to a <tt>si\u1e63</tt>-aorist. The RV. form <tt>tr\u0101\u0301s\u012bth\u0101m</tt> (for <tt>tr\u0101s\u012by\u0101th\u0101m</tt> or <tt>tr\u0101s\u0101th\u0101m</tt>) is an isolated anomaly.\n\na.

Examples, of all the persons found to occur (and including all the accented words), are, in the active: <tt>\u00e7\u00e1\u1e45si\u1e63am, v\u00e1dh\u012bm; m\u00e1th\u012bs, v\u00e1dh\u012bs, y\u0101\u0301v\u012bs, s\u0101\u0301v\u012bs; \u00e1v\u012bt, j\u016b\u0301rv\u012bt, m\u00e1th\u012bt, v\u00e1dh\u012bt, ve\u00e7\u012bt; mardhi\u1e63\u1e6dam, do\u1e63i\u1e63\u1e6dam, hi\u1e45si\u1e63\u1e6dam; avi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101m, j\u00e1ni\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101m, b\u0101dhi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101m; \u00e7rami\u1e63ma, v\u0101di\u1e63ma; vadhi\u1e63\u1e6da</tt> and <tt>vadhi\u1e63\u1e6dana, mathi\u1e63\u1e6dana, hi\u1e45si\u1e63\u1e6da; hv\u0101ri\u1e63us, grah\u012b\u1e63us</tt>; \u2014 in the middle: <tt>r\u0101dhi\u1e63i; j\u00e1ni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101s, mar\u1e63i\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101s, vyathi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101s; kr\u00e1mi\u1e63\u1e6da, j\u00e1ni\u1e63\u1e6da, pavi\u1e63\u1e6da, pr\u00e1thi\u1e63\u1e6da, m\u00e1ndi\u1e63\u1e6da; vyathi\u1e63mahi</tt>. The accent is on the root-syllable (<tt>t\u0101ri\u1e63\u00fas</tt>, AV. once, is doubtless an error).\n\n906. a. Of subjunctive forms with primary endings occur only the 1st sing. act. <tt>davi\u1e63\u0101\u1e47i</tt>, and the 1st pl. mid. (with unstrengthened <tt>e</tt>) <tt>y\u0101ci\u1e63\u0101mahe</tt> and <tt>sani\u1e63\u0101mahe</tt>.\n\nb. Forms with secondary endings are almost limited to 2d and 3d sing. act. There are found: <tt>avi\u1e63as, k\u0101\u0301ni\u1e63as, t\u0101ri\u1e63as, rak\u1e63i\u1e63as, v\u00e1dhi\u1e63as; v\u0101\u0301di\u1e63as, v\u00e9\u1e63i\u1e63as, \u00e7a\u1e45si\u1e63as; k\u0101\u0301ri\u1e63at, jambhi\u1e63at, j\u00f3\u1e63i\u1e63at, tak\u1e63i\u1e63at, t\u0101ri\u1e63at, n\u00edndi\u1e63at, p\u0101\u0301ri\u1e63at, b\u00f3dhi\u1e63at, m\u00e1rdhi\u1e63at, y\u0101ci\u1e63at, yodhi\u1e63at, rak\u1e63i\u1e63at, vani\u1e63at, vyathi\u1e63at, \u00e7a\u1e45si\u1e63at, sani\u1e63at, s\u0101vi\u1e63at</tt>. They are made, it will be noticed, with entire regularity, by adding <tt>a</tt> to the tense-stem in <tt>i\u1e63</tt> before the endings. The only other persons found to occur are the 3d pl. act. <tt>sani\u1e63an</tt> and mid. <tt>s\u00e1ni\u1e63anta</tt> (and TS. has <tt>vani\u1e63anta</tt>,<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>"}]}}}}
