Breitkopf and H\u00e4rtel.  After some consideration, and consultation with friends, I accepted the task, and have since devoted to it what time could be spared from regular duties, after the satisfaction of engagements earlier formed.  If the delay seems a long one, it was nevertheless unavoidable; and I would gladly, in the interest of the work itself, have made it still longer.  In every such case, it is necessary to make a compromise between measurably satisfying a present pressing need, and doing the subject fuller justice at the cost of more time; and it seemed as if the call for a Sanskrit grammar on a somewhat different plan from those already in use \u2014 excellent as some of these in many respects are \u2014 was urgent enough to recommend a speedy completion of the work begun.\n\nThe objects had especially in view of the preparation of this grammar have been the following:\n\n1. To make a presentation of the facts of the language primarily as they show themselves in use in the literature, and only secondarily as they are laid down by the native grammarians.  The earliest European grammars were by the necessity of the case chiefly founded on their native {{hyphenated word start|prede|predecessors}}<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "7"}

{"content": "<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>{{hyphenated word end|cessors|predecessors}}; and a traditional method was thus established which has been perhaps somewhat too closely adhered to, at the expense of clearness and of proportion, as well as of scientific truth.  Accordingly, my attention has not been directed toward a profounder study of the grammatical science of the Hindu schools: their teachings I have been contented to take as already reported to Western learners in the existing Western grammars.\n\n2. To include also in the presentation the forms and constructions of the older language, as exhibited in the Veda and the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a.  Grassmann\u2019s excellent Index-Vocabulary to the Rig-Veda, and my own manuscript one to the Atharva-Veda (which I hope soon to be able to make public<ref>It was published, as vol. XII. of the Journal of the American Oriental Society, in 1861.</ref>), gave me in full detail the great mass of Vedic material; and this, with some assistance from pupils and friends, I have sought to complete, as far as the circumstances permitted, from the other Vedic texts and from the various works of the Br\u0101hmana period, both printed and manuscript.\n\n3. To treat the language throughout as an accented one, omitting nothing of what is known respecting the nature of the Sanskrit accent, its changes in combination and inflection, and the tone of individual words \u2014 being, in all this, necessarily dependent especially upon the material presented by the older accentuated texts.\n\n4. To cast all statements, classifications, and so on, into a form consistent with the teachings of linguistic science.  In doing this, it has been necessary to discard a few of the long-used and familiar divisions and terms of Sanskrit grammar \u2014 for example, the classification and nomenclature of \u201especial tenses\u201d and \u201cgeneral tenses\u201d (which is so indefensible that one can only wonder at its having maintained itself so long), the order and terminology of the conjugation-classes, the separation in treatment of the facts of internal and {{hyphenated word start|ex|external}}<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "8"}

But care has been taken to facilitate the transition from the old to the new; and the changes, it is believed, will commend themselves to unqualified acceptance.  It has been sought also to help an appreciation of the character of the language by putting its facts as far as possible into a statistical form.  In this respect the native grammar is especially deficient and misleading.\n\nRegard has constantly had to the practical needs of the learner of the language, and it has been attempted, by due arrangement and by the use of different sizes of type, to make the work as usable by one whose object it is to acquire a knowledge of the classical Sanskrit alone as those are in which the earlier forms are not included.  The custom of transliterating all Sanskrit words into European characters, which has become usual in European Sanskrit grammars, is, as a matter of course, retained throughout; and, because of the difficulty of setting even a small Sanskrit type with anything but a large European, it is practiced alone in the smaller sizes.\n\nWhile the treatment of the facts of the language has thus been made a historical one, within the limits of the language itself, I have not ventured to make it comparative, by bringing in the analogous forms and processes of other related languages.  To do this, in addition to all that was attempted beside, would have extended the work, both in content and in time of preparation, far beyond the limits assigned to it.  And, having decided to leave out this element, I have done so consistently throughout.  Explanations of the origin of forms have been avoided, for the same reason and for others, which hardly call for statement.\n\nA grammar is necessarily in great part founded on its predecessors, and it would be vain to attempt an acknowledgement in detail of all the aid received from other scholars.  I have had at hand always especially the very scholarly and reliable brief summary of Kielhorn, the full and<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "9"}

As regards to the material of the language, no other aid, of course, has been at all comparable with the great Petersburg lexicon of B\u00f6htlingk and Roth, the existence of which gives by itself a new character to all investigations of the Sanskrit language.

For what concerns the verb, its forms and of their classification and uses, I have had, as every one must have, by far the most aid from Delbr\u00fcck, in his Altindisches Verbum and his various syntactical contributions.  Former pupils of my own, Professors Avery and Edgren, have also helped me, in connection with this subject and with others, in a way and measure that calls for public acknowledgment.  In respect to the important matter of the declension in the earliest language, I have made great use of the elaborate paper in the Journ. Am. Or. Soc. (printed contemporaneously with this work, and used by me almost, but not quite, to the end of the subject) by my former pupil Prof. Lanman; my treatment of it is founded on his.  My manifold obligations to my own teacher, Prof. Weber of Berlin, also require to be mentioned: among other things, I owe to him the use of his copies of certain unpublished texts of the Br\u0101hmana period, not otherwise accessible to me; and he was kind enough to look through with me my work in its inchoate condition, favoring me with valuable suggestions.  For this last favor I have likewise to thank Prof. Delbr\u00fcck \u2014 who, moreover, has taken the trouble to glance over for a like purpose the greater part of the proof-sheets of the grammar, as they came from  the press.

It is thus distinguished, on the one hand, from the later and derived dialects \u2014 as the Pr\u0101krit, forms of language which have datable monuments from as early as the third century before Christ, and which are represented by inscriptions and coins, by the speech of the uneducated characters in the Sanskrit dramas (see below), and by a limited literature; the P\u0101li, a Prakritic dialect which became the sacred language of Buddhism in Farther India, and is<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "13"}

And, on the other hand, it is distinguished, but very much less sharply and widely, from the older dialects or forms of speech presented in the canonical literature, the Veda and Br\u0101hma\u1e47a.\n\nThis fact, of the fixation by learned treatment of an authorized mode of expression, which should thenceforth be used according to rule in the intercourse of the educated, is the cardinal one in Indian linguistic history; and as the native grammatical literature has determined the form of the language, so it has also to a large extent determined the grammatical treatment of the language by European scholars.\n\nMuch in the history of the learned movement is still obscure, and opinions are at variance even as to points of prime consequence.  Only the concluding works in the development of the grammatical science has been preserved to us; and though they are evidently the perfected fruits of a long series of learned labors, the records of the latter are lost beyond recovery.  The time and the place of the creation of Sanskrit are unknown; and as to its occasion, we have only our inferences and conjectures to rely upon.  It seems, however, altogether likely that the grammatical sense of the ancient Hindus was awakened in great measure by their study of the traditional sacred texts, and by their comparison of its different language with that of contemporary use.  It is certain that the grammatical study of those texts (\u00e7\u0101kh\u0101s, lit\u2019ly ''branches''), phonetic and other, was zealously and effectively followed in the Brahmanic schools; this is attested by our possession of a number of phonetico-grammatical treatises, pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas (prati \u00e7\u0101kh\u0101m ''belonging to each several text''), each having for subject one principal Vedic text, and noting all its peculiarities of form; these, both by the depth and exactness of their own researches and by the number of authorities which they quote, speak plainly of a lively scientific activity continued during a long time.

Respecting his period, nothing really definite and trustworthy is known; but he is with much probability held to have lived some time (two to four centuries) before the Christian era. He has had commentators in abundance, and has undergone at their hands some measure of amendment and completion; but he has not been overthrown or superseded.  The chief and most authoritative commentary on his work is that called the Mah\u0101bh\u0101shya ''great comment'', by Patanjali.\n\nA language, even if not a vernacular one, which is in tolerably wide and constant use for writing and speaking, is, of course, kept in life principally by direct tradition, by communication from teacher to scholar and the study and imitation of existing texts, and not by the learning of grammatical rules; yet the existence of grammatical authority, and especially of a single one, deemed infallible and of prescriptive value, could not fail to exert a strong regulative influence, leading to the avoidance of more and more of what was, even if lingering in use, inconsistent with his teachings, and also, in the constant reproduction of texts, to the gradual effacement of whatever they might contain that was unapproved.  Thus the whole more modern literature of India has been Paninized, so to speak, pressed into the mould prepared by him and his school.  What are the limits of the artificiality of this process is not yet known.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "15"}

{"content": "<noinclude><pagequality level=\"4\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>The attention of special students of the Hindu grammar (and the subject is so intricate and difficult that the number is exceedingly small of those who have mastered it sufficiently to have a competent opinion on such general matters) has been hitherto mainly directed toward determining what the Sanskrit according to P\u0101\u1e47ini really is, toward explaining the language from the grammar.  And, naturally enough, in India, or wherever else the leading object is to learn to speak and write the language correctly \u2014 that is, as authorized by the grammarians \u2014 that is the proper course to pursue. This, however, is not the way really to understand the language.  The time must soon come, or it has come already, when the endeavor shall be instead to explain the grammar from the language: to test in all details, so far as shall be found possible, the reason of P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s rules (which contain not a little that seems problematic, or even sometimes perverse); to determine what and how much genuine usage he had everywhere as foundation, and what traces may be left in the literature of usages possessing an inherently authorized character, though unratified by him.\n\nBy the term \u201cclassical\u201d or \u201clater\u201d language, then, as constantly used below in the grammar, is meant the language of those literary monuments which are written in conformity with the rules of the native grammar: virtually, the whole proper Sanskrit literature.  For although parts of this are doubtless earlier than P\u0101\u1e47ini, it is impossible to tell just what parts, or how far they have escaped in their style the leveling influence of the grammar.  The whole, too, may be called so far an artificial literature as it is written in a phonetic form (see grammar, 101 a) which never can have been a truly vernacular and living one.  Nearly all of it is metrical: not poetic works only, but narratives, histories (so far as anything deserving that name can be said to exist), and scientific treatises of every variety, are done into verse; a prose and prose literature hardly has an existence (the principle exceptions, aside from the voluminous commentaries, are a few stories, as the Da\u00e7akum\u0101racarita and the V\u0101savadatt\u0101). Of linguistic history there is next to nothing<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "16"}

At what period these were made and sung cannot be determined with any approach to accuracy: it may have been as early as 2000 B.C.  They were long handed down by oral tradition, preserved by the care, and increased by the additions and imitations, of succeeding generations; the mass was ever growing, and, with the change of habits and beliefs and religious practices, was being variously applied \u2014 sung in chosen extracts, mixed with other material into liturgies, adapted with more or less of distortion to help the needs of a ceremonial which was coming to be of immense elaboration and intricacy.  And, at some time in the course of this history, there was made for preservation a great collection of the hymn-material, mainly its oldest and most genuine part, to the extent of over a thousand hymns and ten thousand verses, arranged according to traditional authorship and to subject and length and metre of hymn: this collection is the Rig-Veda ''Veda of verses'' (\u1e5bc) or of ''hymns''.  Other collections were made also out of the same general mass of traditional material: doubtless later, although the {{hyphenated word start|inter|interrelations}}<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "17"}

Thus, the S\u0101ma-Veda ''Veda of chants'' (s\u0101man), containing only about a sixth as much, its verses nearly all found in the Rig-Veda also, but appearing here with numerous differences of reading: these were passages put together for chanting at the soma-sacrifices.  Again, collections called by the comprehensive name of Yajur-Veda ''Veda of sacrificial formulas'' (yajus): these contained not verses alone, but also numerous prose utterances, mingled with the former, in the order in which they are practically employed in the ceremonies; they were strictly liturgical collections. Of these, there are in existence several texts, which have their mutual differences: the V\u0101jasaneyi-Sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (in two slightly discordant versions, M\u0101dhyandina and K\u0101\u1e47va), sometimes also called the White Yajur-Veda; and the various and considerably differing texts of the Black Yajur-Veda, namely the T\u0101ittir\u012bya-Sa\u1e41hit\u0101, the M\u0101itr\u0101ya\u1e47\u012b-Sa\u1e41hit\u0101, the Kapi\u1e63\u1e6dhala-Sa\u1e41hit\u0101, and the K\u0101\u1e6dhaka (the two last not yet published).  Finally, another historical collection, like the Rig-Veda, but made up mainly of later and less accepted material, and called (among other less current names) the Atharva-Veda ''Veda of the Atharvans'' (a legendary priestly family); it is somewhat more than half as bulky as the Rig-Veda, and contains a certain amount of material corresponding to that of the latter, and also a number of very brief prose passages.  To this last collection is very generally refused in the orthodox literature the name of Veda; but for us it is the most interesting of all, after the Rig-Veda, because it contains the largest amount of hymn-material (or mantra, as it it is called, in distinction from the prose br\u0101ma\u1e47a), and in a language which, though distinctly less antique than that of the other, is nevertheless truly Vedic.  Two versions of it are extant, one of them in only a single known manuscript.\n\nA not insignificant body of like material, and of various period (although doubtless in the main belonging to the latest time of the Vedic productiveness, and in part perhaps<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "18"}

To assemble and sift and compare it is now one of the pressing needs of Vedic study.\n\nThe fundamental divisions of the Vedic literature here mentioned have all had their various schools of sectaries, each of these with a text of its own, showing some differences from those of the other schools: but those mentioned above are all that are now known to be in existence; and the chance of the discovery of others grows every year smaller.\n\nThe labor of the schools in the conservation of their sacred texts was extraordinary, and has been crowned with such success that the text of each school, whatever may be its differences from the other schools, is virtually without various readings, preserved with all its peculiarities of dialect, and its smallest and most exceptional traits of phonetic form, pure and unobscured.  It is not the place here to describe the means by which, in addition to the religious care of the sectaries, this accuracy was secured: forms of text, lists of peculiarities and treatises upon them, and so on.  When this kind of care began in the case of each text, and what of original character may have been effaced before it, or lost in spite of it, cannot be told.  But it is certain that the Vedic records furnish, on the whole, a wonderfully accurate and trustworthy picture of a form of ancient Indian language (as well as ancient Indian beliefs and institutions) which was a natural and undisturbed one, and which goes back a good way behind the classical Sanskrit.  Its differences from the latter the following treatise endeavors to show in detail.\n\nAlong with the verses and sacrificial formulas and phrases in the text of the Black Yajur-Veda are given long prose sections, in which the ceremonies are described, their meaning and the reason of the details and the accompanying utterances are discussed and explained, illustrative legends are reported or fabricated, and various speculations, etymological and other, are indulged in.

Thus, the \u0100itareya and K\u0101u\u1e63\u012btaki-Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, belonging to the schools of the Rig-Veda, the Pa\u00f1cavi\u1e45\u00e7a and \u1e62a\u1e0dvi\u1e45\u00e7a-Br\u0101hma\u1e47as and other minor works, to the S\u0101ma-Veda; the Gopatha-Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, to the Atharva-Veda; and a J\u0101imin\u012bya- or Talavak\u0101ra-Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, to the S\u0101ma-Veda, has recently (Burnell) been discovered in India; the T\u0101ittir\u012bya-Br\u0101ma\u1e47a is a collection of mingled mantra and br\u0101hma\u1e47a, like the sa\u1e41hit\u0101 of the same name, but supplementary and later.  These works are likewise regarded as canonical by the schools, and are learned by their sectaries with the same extreme care which is devoted to the sa\u1e41hit\u0101s, and their condition of textual preservation is of a kindred excellence.  To a certain extent, there is among them the possession of common material: a fact the bearings of which are not yet fully understood.\n\nNotwithstanding the inanity of no small part of their contents, the Br\u0101ma\u1e47as are of a high order of interest in their bearings on the history of Indian institutions; and philologically they are not less important, since they represent a form of language in most respects intermediate between the classical and that of the Vedas, and offer specimens on a large scale of a prose style, and of one which is in the main a natural and freely developed one \u2014 the oldest and most primitive Indo-European prose.\n\nBeside the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as are sometimes found later appendices, of a similar character, called \u0100ra\u1e47yakas (''forest-sections''): as the \u0100itareya-\u0100ra\u1e47yaka, T\u0101ittir\u012bya-\u0100ra\u1e47yaka, B\u1e5bhad-\u0100ra\u1e47yakas, and so on.  And from some of these, or even from the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, are extracted the earliest Upani\u1e63ads (''sittings, lectures on sacred subjects'') \u2014 which,<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "20"}

The Upanishads are one of the lines by which the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a literature passes over into the later theological literature.\n\nAnother line of transition is shown in the S\u016btras (''lines, rules'').  The works thus named are analogous with the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as in that they belong to the schools of Vedic study and are named from them, and that they deal with the religious ceremonies: treating them, however, in the way of prescription, not of dogmatic explanation.  They, too, contain some mantra or hymn-material, not found to occur elsewhere. In part (\u00e7r\u0101uta or kalpa-s\u016btras), they take up the great sacrificial ceremonies, with which the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as have to do; in part (g\u1e5bhya-s\u016btras), they teach the minor duties of a pious householder; in some cases (s\u0101-may\u0101c\u0101rika-s\u016btras) they lay down the general obligations of one whose life is in accordance with prescribed duty.  And out of the last two, or especially the last, come by natural development the law-books (dharma-\u00e7\u0101stras), which make a conspicuous figure in later literature: the oldest and most noted of them being that called by the name of Manu (an outgrowth, it is believed by many, of the M\u0101nava Vedic school); to which are added that of Y\u0101jnavalkya, and many others.\n\nRespecting the chronology of this development, or the date of any class of writings, still more of any individual work, the less that is said the better.  All dates given in Indian literary history are pins set up to be bowled down again.  Every important work has undergone so many more or less transforming changes before reaching the form in which it comes to us, that the question of original construction is complicated with that of final redaction.  It is so with the law-book of Manu, just mentioned, which has well-founded claims to being regarded as one of the very oldest works of the proper Sanskrit literature, if not the the oldest (it has variously been assigned, to periods from six centuries before Christ to four after Christ).  It is so, again, in a still more striking degree, with the great legendary<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "21"}

The ground-work of this is doubtless of very early date; but it has served as a text into which materials of various character and period have been inwoven, until it has become a heterogeneous mass, a kind of cyclopedia for the warrior-caste, hard to separate into its constituent parts. The story of Nala, and the philosophical poem Bhagavad-G\u012bt\u0101, are two of the most noted of its episodes.  The R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, the other most famous epic, is a work of another kind: though also worked over and more or less altered in its transmission to our time, it is the production, in the main, of a single author (V\u0101lm\u012bki); and it is generally believed to be in part allegorical, representing the introduction of Aryan culture and dominion into Southern India.  By its side stand a number of minor epics, of various authorship and period, as the Raghuva\u1e45\u00e7a (ascribed to the dramatist K\u0101lid\u0101sa), the M\u0101ghak\u0101vya, the Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dik\u0101vya (the last, written chiefly with the grammatical intent of illustrating by use as many as possible of the numerous formations which, though taught by the grammarians, find no place in the literature).\n\nThe Pur\u0101\u1e47as, a large class of works mostly of immense extent, are best mentioned in connection with the epics.  They are pseudo-historical and prophetic in character, of modern date, and of inferior value.  Real history finds no place in Sanskrit literature, nor is there any conscious historical element in any of the works composing it.\n\nLyric poetry is represented by many works, some of which, as the Meghad\u016bta and G\u012btogovinda, are of no mean order of merit.\n\nThe drama is a still more noteworthy and important branch.  The first indications of dramatical inclination and capacity on the part of the Hindus are seen in certain hymns of the Veda, where a mythological or legendary situation is conceived dramatically, and set forth in the form of a dialogue \u2014 well-known examples are the dialogue of Saram\u0101 and the Pa\u1e47is, that of Yama and his sister Yam\u012b, that of Vasishtha and the rivers, that of Agni and the other gods \u2014 but there are no extant intermediaries between these<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "22"}

The beginnings of the latter date from a period when in actual life the higher and educated characters used Sanskrit, and the lower and uneducated used the popular dialects derived from it, the Pr\u0101krits; and their dialogue reflects this condition of things.  Then, however learning (not to call it pedantry) intervened, and stereotyped the new element; a Pr\u0101krit grammar grew up beside the Sanskrit grammar, according to the rules of which Pr\u0101krit could be made indefinitely on a substrate of Sanskrit; and none of the existing dramas need to date from the time of the vernacular use of Pr\u0101krit, while most or all of them are undoubtedly much later.  Among the dramatic authors, K\u0101lid\u0101sa is incomparably the chief, and his \u00c7akuntal\u0101 is distinctly his masterpiece.  His date has been a matter of much inquiry and controversy; it is doubtless some centuries later than our era.  The only other worked deserving to be mentioned along with K\u0101lid\u0101sa\u2019s is the M\u1e5bcchaka\u1e6d\u012b of \u00c7\u016bdraka, also of questionable period, but believed to be the oldest of the extant dramas.\n\nA partly dramatic character belongs also to the fable, in which animals are represented as acting and speaking.  The most noted works in this department are the Pa\u00f1catantra, which through Persian and Semitic versions has made its way all over the world, and contributes a considerable quota to the fable-literature of every European language, and, partly founded on it, the comparatively recent and popular Hitopade\u00e7a (''salutary instruction'').\n\nTwo of the leading departments of Sanskrit scientific literature, the legal and the grammatical, have already been sufficiently noticed; of those remaining, the most important is by far the philosophical.  The beginnings of philosophical speculation are seen already in some of the later hymns of the Veda, more abundantly in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as and \u0100ra\u1e47yakas, and then especially in the Upanishads.  The evolution and historical relation of the systems of philosophy, and the age of their text-books, are matters on which much obscurity still rests.  There are six systems of primary rank, and reckoned as orthodox, although really standing in no<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "23"}

All of them seek the same end, the emancipation of the soul from the necessity of continuing its existence in a succession of bodies, and its unification with the All-soul; but they differ in regard to the means by which they seek to attain this end.\n\nThe astronomical science of the Hindus is a reflection of that of Greece, and its literature is of recent date; but as mathematicians, in arithmetic and geometry, they have shown more independence.  Their medical science, although its beginnings go back even to the Veda, in the use of medicinal plants with accompanying incantations, is of little account, and its proper literature by no means ancient.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "24"}

The natives of India write their ancient and sacred language in a variety of alphabets \u2014 generally, in each part of the country, in the same alphabet which they use for their own vernacular.  The mode of writing, however, which is employed throughout the heart of Aryan India, or in Hindustan proper, is alone adopted by European scholars: it is called the devan\u0101gar\u012b.\n\na. This name is of doubtful origin and value.  A more comprehensive name is n\u0101gar\u012b (perhaps, ''of the city''); and deva-n\u0101gar\u012b is ''n\u0101gar\u012b of the gods'', or ''of the Brahmans''.\n\n2. Much that relates to the history of the Indian alphabets is still obscure.  The earliest written monuments of known date in the country are the inscriptions containing the edicts of A\u00e7oka or Piyadasi, of about the middle of the third century B.C.  They are in two different systems of characters, of which one shows distinct signs of derivation from a Semitic source, while the other is also probably, though much less evidently, of the same origin.  From the latter, the La\u1e6dh, or Southern A\u00e7oka character (of Girnar), come the later Indian alphabets, both those of the northern Aryan languages and those of the southern Dravidian languages.  The n\u0101gar\u012b, devan\u0101gar\u012b, Beng\u0101l\u012b, Guzer\u0101t\u012b, and others, are varieties of its northern derivatives; and with them are related some of the alphabets of peoples outside of India \u2014 as in Tibet and Farther India \u2014 who have adopted Hindu culture or religion.\n\na. There is reason to believe that writing was first employed in India for practical purposes \u2014 for correspondence and business and the like \u2014 and only by degrees came to be applied to literary use.  The literature, to a great extent, and the most fully in proportion to its claimed sanctity and authority, ignores all written record, and assumes to be kept in existence by oral tradition alone.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "29"}

Of the <tt>devan\u0101gar\u012b</tt> itself there are minor varieties, depending on differences of locality or of period, as also of individual hand (see examples in Weber\u2019s catalogue of the Berlin Sanskrit MSS., in R\u0101jendral\u0101la Mitra\u2019s notices of MSS. in Indian libraries, in the published fac-similes of inscriptions, and so on); and these are in some measure reflected in the type prepared for printing, both in India and in Europe.  But a student who makes himself familiar with the one style of printed characters will have little difficulty with the others, and will soon learn, by practice, to read the manuscripts.  A few specimens of types other than those used in this work are given in Appendix A.\n\na. On account of the difficulty of combining them with the smaller sizes of our Roman and Italic type, the <tt>devan\u0101gar\u012b</tt> characters are used below only in connection with the first or largest size.  And, in accordance with the laudable usage of recent grammars, they are, wherever given, also transliterated, in Clarendon letters; while the latter alone are used in the other sizes.\n\n4. The student may be advised to try to familiarize himself from the start with the <tt>devan\u0101gar\u012b</tt> mode of writing.  At the same time, it is not indispensable that he should do so until, having learned the principal paradigms, he comes to begin reading and analysing the parsing; and many will find the latter the more practical, and in the end equally or more effective, way.\n\n5. The characters of the <tt>devan\u0101gar\u012b</tt> alphabet, and the European letters which will be used in transliterating them, are as follows:\n<div align=\"center\">\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n!rowspan=8|Vowels\n|\n|\n!short\n!long\n|-\n!rowspan=5|simple\n|\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">1</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0905</span> a\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">2</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0906</span> \u0101\n|-\n!palatal\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">3</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0907</span> i\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">4</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0908</span> \u012b\n|-\n!labial\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">5</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0909</span> u\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">6</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u090a</span> \u016b\n|-\n!lingual\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">7</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u090b</span> \u1e5b\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">8</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0960</span> \u1e5d\n|-\n!dental\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">9</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u090c</span> \u1e37\n|[<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">10</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0961</span> [\u1e39]\n|-\n!rowspan=2|diphthongs\n!palatal\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">11</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u090f</span> e\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">12</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0910</span> \u0101i\n|-\n!labial\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">13</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0913</span> o\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">14</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0914</span> \u0101u\n|}\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n!Visarga\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">15</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0905\u0903</span> \u1e25\n|-\n!Anusv\u0101ra\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">16</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0905\u0902, \u0905\u0901</span> \u1e45 or \u1e41 (see 73 c).\n|}\n\n{| class=\"prettytable\"\n|\n|\n!surd\n!surd asp.\n!sonant\n!son.asp.\n!nasal\n|-\n!rowspan=5|Mutes\n!guttural\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">17</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0915</span> k\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">18</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0916</span> kh\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">19</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0917</span> g\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">20</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0918</span> gh\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">21</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0919</span> n\u0304\n|-\n!palatal\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">22</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u091a</span> c\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">23</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u091b</span> ch\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">24</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u091c</span> j\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">25</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u091d</span> jh\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">26</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u091e</span> \u00f1\n|-\n!lingual\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">27</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u091f</span> \u1e6d\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">28</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0920</span> \u1e6dh\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">29</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0921</span> \u1e0d\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">30</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0922</span> \u1e0dh\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">31</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0923</span> \u1e47\n|-\n!dental\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">32</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0924</span> t\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">33</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0925</span> th\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">34</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0926</span> d\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">35</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0927</span> dh\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">36</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u0928</span> n\n|-\n!labial\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">37</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u092a</span> p\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">38</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u092b</span> ph\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">39</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u092c</span> b\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">40</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u092d</span> bh\n|<span style=\"font-size:50%;\">41</span> <span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">\u092e</span> m\n|}\n</div><noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "30"}

To these may be added a lingual \u1e3b \u0933, which in some of the Vedic texts takes the place of \u0921 \u1e0d when occurring between two vowels ({{Self reference|54|../Chapter II|Page:Sanskrit Grammar by Whitney p1.djvu/47|54}}).\n\n6. A few other sounds, recognized by the theories of the Hindu grammarians, but either having no separate characters to represent them or only very rarely and exceptionally written, will be noticed below (71 b, c, 230).  Such are the guttural and labial breathings, the nasal semivowels, and others.\n\n7. The order of arrangement given above is that in which the sounds are catalogued and described by the native grammarians; and it has been adopted by the European scholars as the alphabetic order, for indexes, dictionaries, etc.: to the Hindus, the idea of an alphabetic arrangement for such practical uses is wanting.\n\na. In some works (as the Petersburg lexicon), a <tt>visarga</tt> which is regarded as equivalent to and exchangeable with a sibilant (172) is, though written as a <tt>visarga</tt>, given the alphabetic place of the sibilant.\n\n8. The theory of the <tt>devan\u0101gar\u012b</tt>, as of the other Indian modes of writing, is syllabic and consonantal.  That is to say, it regards as the written unit, not the simple sound, but the syllable (<tt>ak\u1e63ara</tt>); and further, as the substantial part of the syllable, the consonant or the consonants which precede the vowel \u2014 this latter being merely implied, or, if written, being written by a subordinate sign attached to the consonant.\n\n9. Hence follow these two principles:\n\nA.

In combinations with a consonant, other modes of representation are used.\n\nB. If more consonants than one precede the vowel, forming with it a single syllable, their characters must be combined into a single compound character.\n\n{{section|9a}}a. Native Hindu usage, in manuscripts and inscriptions, treats the whole material of a sentence alike, not separating its words from one another, any more than the syllables of the same word: a final consonant is combined into one written syllable with the initial vowel or consonant or consonants of the following word.  It never occurred to the Hindus to space their words in any way, even where the mode of writing admitted such treatment; nor to begin a paragraph on a new line; nor to write one line of verse under another: everything, without exception, is written solid by them, filling the whole page.\n\n{{section|9b}}b. Thus, the sentence and verse-line <tt>aha\u1e41 rudrebhir vasubhi\u00e7 car\u0101my aham \u0101dity\u0101ir uta vi\u00e7vadev\u0101i\u1e25</tt> (Rig-Veda X, 125. 1: see Appendix B) ''I wander with the Vasus, the Rudras, I with the \u0100dityas and the All-Gods'' is thus syllabized: <tt>a ha\u1e41 ru dre bhi rva su bhi \u00e7ca r\u0101 mya ha m\u0101 di ty\u0101i ru ta vi \u00e7va de v\u0101i\u1e25</tt>, with each syllable ending with a vowel (or a vowel modified by the nasal-sign <tt>anusv\u0101ra</tt>, or having the sign of a final breathing, <tt>visarga</tt>, added: these being the only elements that can follow a vowel in the same syllable); and it is (together with the next line) written in the manuscripts after this fashion:\n\n<center><big>\n\u0905\u0939\u0901\u0930\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0947\u092d\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0938\u0941\u092d\u093f\u0936\u094d\u091a\u0930\u093e\u092e\u094d\u092f\u0939\u092e\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0948\n\n\u0930\u0941\u0924\u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0948\u0903\u0964\u0905\u0939\u0902\u092e\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0930\u0941\u0923\u094b\u092d\u093e\n\n\u092c\u093f\u092d\u0930\u094d\u092e\u094d\u092f\u0939\u092e\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0917\u094d\u0928\u0940\u0939\u092e\u0936\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0928\u094b\u092d\u093e\u0965\n</center></big>\n\nEach syllable is written separately, and by many scribes the successive syllables are parted a little from one another: thus,\n\n<center><big>\n\u0905 \u0939\u0901 \u0930\u0941 \u0926\u094d\u0930\u0947 \u092d\u093f \u0930\u094d\u0935 \u0938\u0941 \u092d\u093f \u0936\u094d\u091a \u0930\u093e \u092e\u094d\u092f \u0939 \u092e\u093e \u0926\u093f \u0924\u094d\u092f\u0948\n</center></big>\n\nand so on.\n\nc.

In transliterating, Western methods of separation of words are of course to be followed; to do otherwise would be simple pedantry.\n\n10. Under A, it is to be noticed that the modes of indicating a vowel combined with a preceding consonant are as follows:\n\na. The short \u0905 <tt>a</tt> has no written sign at all; the consonant-sign itself implies a following \u0905 <tt>a</tt>, unless some other vowel-sign is attached to it (or else the <tt>vir\u0101ma</tt>: 11). Thus, the consonant-signs as given above in the alphabetic scheme are really the signs of the syllables <tt>ka</tt>, <tt>kha</tt>, etc. etc. (to <tt>ha</tt>).\n\nb. The long \u0906 <tt>\u0101</tt> is written by a perpendicular stroke after the consonant: thus, \u0915\u093e <tt>k\u0101</tt>, \u0926\u093e <tt>d\u0101</tt>, \u0939\u093e <tt>h\u0101</tt>.\n\nc. Short \u0907 <tt>i</tt> and long \u0908 <tt>\u012b</tt> are written by a similar stroke, which for short <tt>i</tt> is placed before the consonant and for long <tt>\u012b</tt> is placed after it, and in either case is connected with the consonant by a hook above the upper line: thus, \u0915\u093f <tt>ki</tt>, \u0915\u0940 <tt>k\u012b</tt>; \u092d\u093f <tt>bhi</tt>, \u092d\u0940 <tt>bh\u012b</tt>; \u0928\u093f <tt>ni</tt>, \u0928\u0940 <tt>n\u012b</tt>.\n\nThe hook above, turning to the left or to the right, is historically the essential part of the character, having been originally the whole of it; the hooks were only later prolonged, so as to reach all the way down beside the consonant.  In the MSS., they almost never have the horizontal stroke drawn across them above, though this is added in the printed characters: thus, originally [[Image:kioriginal.png|20px]] <tt>ki</tt>, [[Image:k\u012boriginal.png|20px]] <tt>k\u012b</tt>; in the MSS. [[Image:kimss.png|20px]], [[Image:k\u012bmss.png|20px]]; in print \u0915\u093f, \u0915\u0940.\n\nd. The <tt>u</tt>-sounds, short and long, are written by hooks attached to the lower end of the consonant-sign: thus \u0915\u0941 <tt>ku</tt>, \u0915\u0942 <tt>k\u016b</tt>; \u0921\u0941 <tt>du</tt>, \u0921\u0942 <tt>d\u016b</tt>.  On account of the necessities of combination, <tt>du</tt> and <tt>d\u016b</tt> are somewhat disguised: thus, [[Image:Du sanskrit.png|20px]], [[Image:Duu sanskrit.png|20px]]; and the forms with \u0930 <tt>r</tt> and \u0939 <tt>h</tt> are still more irregular: thus, \u0930\u0941 <tt>ru</tt>, \u0930\u0942 <tt>r\u016b</tt>; \u0939\u0941 <tt>hu</tt>, \u0939\u0942 <tt>h\u016b</tt>.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "33"}

The <tt>\u1e5b</tt>-vowels, short and long, are written by a subjoined hook, single or double, opening toward the right: thus, \u0915\u0943 <tt>k\u1e5b</tt>, \u0915\u0944 <tt>k\u1e5d</tt>; \u0926\u0943 <tt>d\u1e5b</tt>, \u0926\u0944 <tt>d\u1e5d</tt>.  In the <tt>h</tt>-sign, the hooks are usually attached to the middle, thus: \u0939\u0943 <tt>h\u1e5b</tt>, \u0939\u0944 </tt>h\u1e5d<tt>.\n\nAs to the combination of <tt>\u1e5b</tt> with preceding <tt>r</tt>, see below, 14 d.\n\nf. The <tt>\u1e37</tt>-vowel is written with a reduced form of its full initial character: thus, \u0915\u0962 <tt>k\u1e37</tt>; the corresponding long has no real occurrence (23 a), but would be written with a similar reduced sign.\n\ng. The diphthongs are written by strokes, single or double, above the upper line, combined, for \u0913 <tt>o</tt> and \u0914 <tt>\u0101u</tt>, with the <tt>\u0101</tt>-sign after the consonant: thus, \u0915\u0947 <tt>ke</tt>, \u0915\u0948 <tt>k\u0101i</tt>; \u0915\u094b <tt>ko</tt>, \u0915\u094c <tt>k\u0101u</tt>.\n\nh. In some <tt>devan\u0101gar\u012b</tt> manuscripts (as the <tt>Beng\u0101l\u012b</tt> alphabet), the single stroke above, or one of the double ones, is replaced by a sign like the <tt>\u0101</tt>-sign before the consonant, thus: [[Image:Sanskrit-grammar-alt-ke.png|20px]] <tt>ke</tt>, [[Image:Sanskrit-grammar-alt-k\u0101i.png|\n20px]] <tt>k\u0101i</tt>; [[Image:Sanskrit-grammar-alt-ko.png|20px]] <tt>ko</tt>, [[Image:Sanskrit-grammar-alt-k\u0101u.png|20px]] <tt>k\u0101u</tt>.\n\n11. A consonant-sign, however, is capable of being made to signify the consonant-sound alone, without an added vowel, by having written beneath it a stroke called the <tt>vir\u0101ma</tt> ''(rest, stop)'': thus, \u0915\u094d <tt>k</tt>, \u0926\u094d <tt>d</tt>, \u0939\u094d <tt>h</tt>.\n\na. Since, as was pointed out above, the Hindus write the words of a sentence continuously like one word (9 a, 9 b), the <tt>vir\u0101ma</tt> is in general called only for when a final consonant occurs before a pause.  But it is also occasionally resorted to by scribes, or in print, in order to avoid an awkward or difficult combination of consonant-signs: thus,\n\n<center>\n\u0932\u093f\u0921\u094d\u200b\u092d\u093f\u0903 <tt>li\u1e0dbhi\u1e25</tt>, \u0932\u093f\u091f\u094d\u200b\u0938\u0941 <tt>li\u1e6dsu</tt>, \u0905\u0919\u094d\u200c\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u0935 <tt>an\u0304k\u1e63va</tt>;\n</center>\n\nand it is used to make a separation of words in texts prepared for beginners (9 d).\n\n12. Under B, it is to be noticed that the consonant combinations are for the most part not at all difficult to make or to recognize for one who is familiar with the simple signs.  The characteristic part of a consonant-sign that is to be added to another is taken (to the exclusion of the horizontal or of the perpendicular framing-line, or of both), and they are put together according to convenience,<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "34"}

The numeral figures are\n\n:\u0967 1, \u0968 2, \u0969 3, \u096a 4, \u096b 5, \u096c 6, \u096d 7, \u096e 8, \u096f 9, \u0966 0\n\nIn combination, to express larger numbers, they are used in precisely the same way as European digits: thus, \u0968\u096b 25, \u096c\u0969\u0966 630, \u096d\u0966\u0966\u0966 7000, \u0967\u096e\u096f\u096c 1896.\n\n18. The Hindu grammarians call the different sounds, and the characters representing them, by a <tt>k\u0101ra</tt> (''maker'') added to the sound of the letter, if a vowel, or to the letter followed by <tt>a</tt>, if consonant.  Thus, the sound or character <tt>a</tt> is called <tt>ak\u0101ra</tt>; <tt>k</tt> is <tt>kak\u0101ra</tt>; and so on.  But the <tt>k\u0101ra</tt> is also omitted, and <tt>a, ka</tt>, etc. are used alone.  The <tt>r</tt>, however, is not called <tt>rak\u0101ra</tt>, but only <tt>ra</tt>, or <tt>repha</tt> ''snarl'': the sole example of a specific name for an alphabetic element of its class.  The <tt>anusv\u0101ra</tt> and <tt>visarga</tt> are also known by those names alone.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "37"}

Vowels.</center>\n\n19. The <tt>a, i</tt>, and <tt>u</tt>-vowels. The Sanskrit has these three earliest and most universal vowels of Indo-European language, in both short and long form \u2014 \u0905 <tt>a</tt> and \u0906 <tt>\u0101</tt>, \u0907 <tt>i</tt> and \u0908 <tt>\u012b</tt>, \u0909 <tt>u</tt> and \u090a <tt>\u016b</tt>. They are to be pronounced in the \u201cContinental\u201d or \u201cItalian\u201d manner \u2014 as in ''far'' or ''farther'', ''pin'' and pique, ''pull'' and ''rule''.\n\n20. The a is the openest vowel, an utterance from the expanded throat, stands in no relation of kindred with any of the classes of consonantal sounds, and has no corresponding semivowel. Of the close vowels <tt>i</tt> and <tt>u</tt>, on the other hand, <tt>i</tt> is palatal, and shades through its semivowel <tt>y</tt> into the palatal and guttural consonant-classes; <tt>u</tt> is similarly related, through its semivowel <tt>v</tt>, to the labial class, as involving in its utterance a narrowing and rounding of the lips.\n\na. The Paninean scheme (commentary to <tt>P\u0101\u1e47ini</tt>\u2019s grammar i. 1. 9) classes <tt>a</tt> as guttural, but apparently only to give that series as well as the rest a vowel; no one of the <tt>Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas</tt> puts <tt>a</tt> into one class with <tt>k</tt> etc. All of these authorities concur in calling the <tt>i</tt>- and <tt>u</tt>-vowels respectively palatal and labial.\n\n21. The short <tt>a</tt> is not pronounced in India with the full openness of <tt>\u0101</tt>, as its corresponding short, but usually as the \u201cneutral vowel\u201d (English so called \u201cshort ''u''\u201d, of ''but, son, blood'', etc.). This peculiarity appears very early, being acknowledged by <tt>P\u0101\u1e47ini</tt> and by two of the <tt>Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas</tt> (APr. i. 36; VPr. i. 72), which call the utterance <tt>sa\u1e41v\u1e5bta</tt>, ''covered up, dimmed''. It is wont to be ignored by Western scholars, except those who have studied in India.\n\n22. The <tt>a</tt>-vowels are the prevailing vowel-sounds of the language, being about twice as frequent as all the others (including diphthongs) taken together. The <tt>i</tt>-vowels, again, are about twice as numerous as the <tt>u</tt>-vowels. And, in each pair, the short vowel is more than twice (2\u00bd to 3 times) as common as the long.\n\na.

The \u1e5b- and \u1e37-vowels. To the three simple vowels already mentioned the Sanskrit adds two others, the \u1e5b-vowel and the \u1e37-vowel, plainly generated by the abbreviation of syllables containing respectively a \u0930\u094d r or \u0932\u094d l along with another vowel: the \u090b \u1e5b coming almost always (see 237, 241\u20133) from \u0905\u0930\u094d ar or \u0930 ra, the \u1e37 from \u0905\u0932\u094d al.\n\na. Some of the Hindu grammarians add to the alphabet also a long \u1e37: but this is only for the sake of an artificial symmetry, since the sound does not occur in a single genuine word in the language.\n\n24. The vowel \u090b \u1e5b is simply a smooth or untrilled ''r''-sound, assuming a vocalic office in syllable-making \u2014 as, by a like abbreviation, it has done also in certain Slavonic languages. The vowel \u090c \u1e37 is an ''l''-sound similarly uttered \u2014 like the English l-vowel in such words as ''able, angle, addle''.\n\na. The modern Hindus pronounce these vowels as ''ri, r\u012b, li'' (or even ''lri''), having long lost the habit and the facility of giving a vowel value to the pure ''r''- and ''l''-sounds. Their example is widely followed by European scholars; and hence also the (distorting and altogether objectionable) transliterations \u1e5bi, \u1e5b\u012b, \u1e37i. There is no real difficulty in the way of acquiring and practising the true utterance.\n\nb. Some of the grammarians (see APr. i. 37, note) attempt to define more nearly the way in which, in these vowels, a real ''r''- or ''l''-element is combined with something else.\n\n25. Like their corresponding semivowels, r and l, these vowels belong respectively in the general lingual and dental classes; the euphonic influence of \u1e5b and \u1e5d (189) shows this clearly. They are so ranked in the Paninean scheme; but the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas in general strangely class them with the jihv\u0101m\u016bl\u012bya sounds, our \u201cgutturals\u201d (39).\n\n26. The short \u1e5b is found in every variety of word and of position, and is not rare, being just about as frequent as long \u016b. Long \u1e5d is very much more unusual, occurring only in certain plural cases of noun-stems in \u1e5b (371 b, d, 375). The \u1e37 is met with only in some of the forms and derivatives of a single not very common verbal root (k\u1e37p).\n\n27.  The diphthongs.  Of the four diphthongs, two, the \u090f e and the \u0913 o, are in great part original Indo-European<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "39"}

In the Sanskrit, they wear the aspect of being products of the increment or strengthening of \u0907 i and \u0909 u respectively; and they are called the corresponding gu\u1e47a-vowels to the latter (see below, 235 ff.). The other two, \u0910 \u0101i and \u0914 \u0101u, are held to be of peculiar Sanskrit growth; they are also in general results of another and higher increment of \u0907 i and \u0909 u, to which they are called the corresponding v\u1e5bddhi-vowels (below, 235 ff.). But all are likewise sometimes generated by euphonic combination (127); and \u0913 o, especially, is common as a result of the alteration of a final \u0905\u0938\u094d as (175).\n\n28. The \u090f e and \u0913 o are, both in India and Europe, usually pronounced as they are transliterated \u2014 that is, as a long ''e''- (English \u201clong a\u201d, or ''e'' in ''they'') and ''o''-sounds, without diphthongal character.\n\na. Such they apparently already were to the authors of the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas, which, while ranking them as diphthongs (sa\u1e41dhyak\u1e63ara), give rules respecting their pronunciation in a manner implying them to be virtually unitary sounds. But their euphonic treatment (131\u20134) clearly shows them to have been still at the period when the euphonic laws established themselves, as they of course were at their origin, real diphthongs, ''ai'' (''a'' + ''i'') and ''au'' (''a'' + ''u''). From them, on the same evidence, the heavier or v\u1e5bddhi diphthongs were distinguished by the length of their ''a''-element, as ''\u0101i'' (''\u0101'' + ''i'') and ''\u0101u'' (''\u0101'' + ''u'').\n\nb. The recognizable distinctness of the two elements in the v\u1e5bddhi-diphthongs is noticed by the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas (see APr. i. 40, note); but the relation of those elements is either defined as equal, or the ''a'' is made of less quantity than the ''i'' and ''u''.\n\n29. The lighter or gu\u1e47a-diphthongs are much more frequent (6 or 7 times) than the heavier or v\u1e5bddhi-diphthongs, and the e and \u0101i than the o and \u0101u (a half more). Both pairs are somewhat more than half as common as the simple i- and u-vowels.\n\n30. The general name given by the Hindu grammarians to the vowels is svara ''tone''; the simple vowels are called sam\u0101n\u0101k\u1e63ara ''homogeneous syllable'', and the diphthongs are called sandhyak\u1e63ara ''combination-syllable''. The position of the organs in their utterance is defined to be one of openness, or of non-closure.\n\na.

The Hindu name for \u2018consonant\u2019 is vya\u00f1jana ''manifester''. The consonants are divided by the grammarians into spar\u00e7a ''contact'' or mute, anta\u1e25sth\u0101, ''intermediate'' or semivowel, and \u016b\u1e63man ''spirant''. They will here be taken up and described in this order.\n\n32. Mutes. The mutes, spar\u00e7a, are so called as involving a complete closure or contact (spar\u00e7a), and not an approximation only, of the mouth-organs by which they are produced. They are divided into five classes or series (varga), according to the organs and parts of organs by which the contact is made; and each series is composed of five members, differing according to the accompaniments of the contact.\n\n33. The five mute-series are called respectively guttural, palatal, lingual (or cerebral), dental, and labial; and they are arranged in the order as just mentioned, beginning with the contact made furthest back in the mouth, coming forward from point to point, and ending with the frontmost contact.\n\n34. In each series there are two surd members, two sonant, and one nasal (which is also a sonant): for example, in the labial series \u092a\u094d p and \u092b\u094d ph, \u092c\u094d b and \u092d\u094d bh, and \u092e\u094d m.\n\na. The members are by the Hindu grammarians called respectively ''first, second, third, fourth'', and ''last'' or ''fifth''.\n\nb. The surd consonants are known as agho\u1e63a ''toneless'', and the sonants as gho\u1e63avant ''having tone''; and the descriptions of the grammarians are in accordance with these terms. All alike recognize a difference of tone, and not in any manner a difference of force, whether of contact or of expulsion, as separating the two great classes in question. That the difference depends on viv\u0101ra ''opening'' or sa\u1e41v\u0101ra ''closure'' (of the glottis), is also recognized by them.\n\n35. The first and third members of each series are the ordinary corresponding surd and sonant mutes of European languages: thus, \u0915\u094d k and \u0917\u094d g, \u0924\u094d t and \u0926\u094d d, \u092a\u094d p and \u092c\u094d b.\n\n36. Nor is the character of the nasal any more doubtful. What \u092e m is to \u092a\u094d p and \u092c\u094d b, or \u0928\u094d n to \u0924\u094d t and \u0926\u094d d, that is also each other nasal to its own series of mutes: a sonant expulsion into and through the nose, while the mouth-organs are in the mute-contact.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "41"}

{"content": "<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude><p>a. The Hindu grammarians give distinctly this definition. The nasal (anun\u0101sika ''passing through the nose'') sounds are declared to be formed by mouth and nose together; or their nasality (\u0101nun\u0101sikya) to be given them by unclosure of the nose.</p>\n\n37. The second and fourth of each series are aspirates: thus, beside the surd mute \u0915\u094d k we have the corresponding surd aspirate \u0916\u094d kh, and beside the sonant \u0917\u094d g, the corresponding sonant aspirate \u0918\u094d gh. Of these, the precise character is more obscure and difficult to determine.\n\na. That the aspirates, all of them, are real mutes or contact sounds, and not fricative (like European ''th'' and ''ph'' and ''ch'', etc.), is beyond question.\n\nb. It is also not doubtful in what way the surd th, for example, differs from the unaspirated t: such aspirates are found in many Asiatic languages, and even in some European; they involve the slipping-out of an audible bit of ''flatus'' or aspiration between the breach of mute-closure and the following sound, whatever it may be. They are accurately enough represented by the th etc., with which, in imitation of the Latin treatment of the similar ancient Greek aspirates, we are accustomed to write them.\n\nc. The sonant aspirates are generally understood and described as made in a similar way, with a perceptible ''h''-sound after the breach of sonant mute-closure But there are great theoretical difficulties in the way of accepting this explanation; and some of the best phonetic observers deny that the modern Hindu pronunciation is of such a character, and define the element following the mute as a \u201cglottal buzz\u201d, rather, or as an emphasized utterance of the beginning of the succeeding sound. The question is one of great difficulty, and upon it the opinions of the highest authorities are much at variance. Sonant aspirates are still in use in India, in the pronunciation of the vernacular as well as of the learned language.\n\nd. By the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas, the aspirates of both classes are called so\u1e63man: which might mean either ''accompanied by a rush of breath'' (taking \u016b\u1e63man in its more etymological sense), or ''accompanied by a spirant'' (below, 59). And some native authorities define the surd aspirate as made by the combination of each surd non-aspirate with its own corresponding surd spirant, the h-sound (below, 65). But this would make the two classes of aspirates of quite diverse character, and would also make th the same as ts, \u1e6dh as \u1e6d\u1e63, ch as c\u00e7 \u2014 which is in any measure plausible only of the last. P\u0101\u1e47ini has no name for aspirates; the scheme given in his comment (to i. 1. 9) attributes to them mah\u0101pr\u0101\u1e47a ''great expiration'', and to the non-aspirates alpapr\u0101\u1e47a ''small expiration''.\n\ne. It is usual among European scholars to pronounce both classes of aspirates as the corresponding non-aspirates<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "42"}
{"index": {"_type": "wg", "_id": "43", "_index": "test-index"}}
{"content": "<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>with a following h: for example \u0925\u094d th nearly as in English ''boathook'', \u092b\u094d ph as in ''haphazard'', \u0927\u094d dh as in ''madhouse'', \u092d\u094d bh as in ''abhor'', and so on. This is (as we have seen above) strictly accurate only as regards the surd aspirates.\n\n38. The sonant aspirates are (in the opinion of most), or at least represent, original Indo-European sounds, while the surd aspirates are a special Indian development. The former are more than twice as common as the latter. The unaspirated (non-nasal) mutes are very much more frequent (5 times) than the aspirates (for the special frequency of bh and the original gh, see 50 and 66); and among them the surds are more numerous (2\u00bd times) than the sonants. The nasals (chiefly n and m) are nearly as frequent as the surd non-aspirates.\n\nWe take up now the several mute series.\n\n39. Guttural series: \u0915\u094d k, \u0916\u094d kh, \u0917\u094d g, \u0918\u094d gh, \u0919\u094d n\u0304. These are the ordinary European ''k'' and ''g''-sounds, with their corresponding aspirates and nasal (the last, like English ''ng'' in ''singing'').\n\na. The gutturals are defined by the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas as made by contact of the base of the tongue with the base of the jaw, and they are called, from the former organ, jihv\u0101m\u016bl\u012bya ''tongue-root sounds''. The Paninean scheme describes them simply as made in the throat (ka\u1e47\u1e6dha). From the euphonic influence of a k on a following s (below, 180), we may perhaps infer that in their utterance the tongue was well drawn back in the mouth.\n\n40. The k is by far the commonest of the guttural series, occurring considerably more often than all the other four taken together. The nasal, except as standing before one of the others of the same series, is found only as final (after the loss of a following k: 386, 407) in a very small number of words, and as product of the assimilation of final k to a following nasal (161).\n\n41. The Sanskrit guttural series represents only a minority of Indo-European gutturals; these last have suffered more and more general corruption than any other class of consonants. By processes of alteration which began in the Indo-European period, the palatal mutes, the palatant sibilant \u00e7, and the aspiration h, have come from gutturals. See these various sounds below.\n\n42. Palatal series: \u091a\u094d c, \u091b\u094d ch, \u091c\u094d j, \u091d\u094d jh, \u091e\u094d \u00f1.\n\nThe whole palatal series is derivative, being generated by the corruption of original gutturals. The c comes from an original k \u2014 as does also, by another degree of alteration, the palatal sibilant \u00e7 (see below, 64). The j, in like manner, comes from a g; but the<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "43"}

{"content": "<noinclude><pagequality level=\"3\" user=\"Prosody\" /><div class=\"pagetext\">\n\n\n</noinclude>Sanskrit j includes in itself two degrees of alteration, one corresponding to the alteration of k to c, the other to that of k to \u00e7 (see below, 219). The c is somewhat more common than the j (almost as four to three). The aspirate ch is very much less frequent (a tenth of c), and comes from the original group sk. The sonant aspirate jh is excessively rare (occurring but once in RV., not once in AV., and hardly half-a-dozen times in the whole other language); where found, it is either onomatopoetic or of anomalous or not Indo-European origin. The nasal, \u00f1, never occurs except immediately before \u2014 or, in a small number of words, also after (201) \u2014 one of the others of the same series.\n\n43. Hence, in the euphonic processes of the language, the treatment of the palatals is in many respects peculiar. In some situations, the original unaltered guttural shows itself \u2014 or, as it appears from the point of view of the Sanskrit, the palatal reverts to its original guttural. No palatal ever occurs as a final. The j is differently treated, according as it represents the one or the other degree of alteration. And c and j (except artificially, in the algebraic rules of the grammarians) do not interchange, as corresponding surd and sonant.\n\n44. The palatal mutes are by European scholars, as by the modern Hindus also, pronounced with the compound sounds of English ''ch'' and ''j'' (in ''church'' and ''judge'').\n\na. Their description by the old Hindu grammarians, however, gives them a not less absolutely simple character than belongs to the other mutes. They are called t\u0101lavya ''palatal'', and declared to be formed against the palate by the middle of the tongue. They seem to have been, then, brought forward in the mouth from the guttural point, and made against the hard palate at a point not far from the lingual one (below, 45), but with the upper flat surface of the tongue instead of its point. Such sounds, in all languages, pass easily into the (English) ''ch''- and ''j''- sounds. The value of the ch as making the preceding vowel \u201clong by position\u201d (227), and its frequent origination from t + \u00e7 (203), lead to the suspicion that it, at least, may have had this character from the beginning: compare 37 d, above.\n\n45. Lingual series: \u091f\u094d \u1e6d, \u0920\u094d \u1e6dh, \u0921\u094d \u1e0d, \u0922\u094d \u1e0dh, \u0923\u094d \u1e47. The lingual mutes are by all the native authorities defined as uttered with the tip of the tongue turned up and drawn back into the dome of the palate (somewhat as the usual English smooth ''r'' is pronounced). They are called by the grammarians m\u016brdhanya, literally ''head-sounds'', ''capitals'', ''cephalics''; which term is in many European grammars<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "44"}

In practice, among European Sanskritists, no attempt is made to distinguish them from the dentals: \u091f\u094d \u1e6d is pronounced like \u0924\u094d t, \u0921\u094d \u1e0d like \u0926 d, and so on with the rest.\n\n46. The linguals are another non-original series of sounds, coming mainly from the phonetic alteration of the next series, the dentals, but also in part occurring in words that have no traceable Indo-European connection, and are perhaps derived from the aboriginal languages of India. The tendency to lingualization is a positive one in the history of the language: dentals easily pass into linguals under the influence of contiguous or neighboring lingual sounds, but not the contrary; and all the sounds of the class become markedly more frequent in the later literature. The conditions of their ordinary occurrence are briefly these: 1. \u1e63 comes from s, much more rarely from \u00e7, j, k\u1e63, in euphonic circumstances stated below (180, 218 ff.); 2. a dental mute following \u1e63 is assimilated into it, becoming lingual (\u1e6d, \u1e6dh, \u1e47: 197); 3. n is often changed to \u1e47 after a lingual vowel or semivowel or sibilant in the same word (189 ff.); 4. \u1e0dh, which is of very rare occurrence, comes from assimilation of a dental after \u1e63 (198 a) or h (222); 5. \u1e6d and \u1e0d come occasionally by substitution for some other sound which is not allowed to stand as final (142, 145\u20137). When originated in these ways, the lingual letters may be regarded as normal; in any other cases of their occurrence, they are either products of abnormal corruption, or signs of the non-Indo-European character of the words in which they appear.\n\na. In a certain number of passages numerically examined (below, 75), the abnormal occurrences of lingual mutes were less than half of the whole number (74 out of 159), and most of them (43) were of \u1e47: all were found more frequent in the later passages. In the Rig-Veda, only 15 words have an abnormal \u1e6d; only 6, such a \u1e6dh; only 1, such a \u1e0dh; about 20 (including 9 roots, nearly all of which have derivatives) show an abnormal \u1e0d, besides 9 that have \u1e47\u1e0d; and 30 (including 1 root) show an \u1e47.\n\nb. Taken all together, the linguals are by far the rarest class of mutes (about 1\u00bd per cent. of the alphabet) \u2014 hardly half as frequent even as the palatals.\n\n47. Dental series: \u0924\u094d t, \u0925\u094d th, \u0926\u094d d, \u0927\u094d dh, \u0928\u094d n. These are called by the Hindus also dantya ''dental'', and are described as formed at the teeth (or at the roots of the teeth), by the tip of the tongue. They are practically the equivalents of our European ''t'', ''d'', ''n''.\n\na. But the modern Hindus are said to pronounce their dentals with the<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "45"}

The absence of that quality in the European (especially the English) dentals is doubtless the reason why to the ear of a Hindu the latter appear more analogous with his linguals, and he is apt to use the linguals in writing European words.\n\n48. The dentals are one of the Indo-European original mute-classes. In their occurrence in Sanskrit they are just about as frequent as all the other four classes taken together.\n\n49. Labial series: \u092a\u094d p, \u092b\u094d ph, \u092c\u094d b, \u092d\u094d bh, \u092e\u094d m. These sounds are called o\u1e63\u1e6dhya ''labial'' by the Hindu grammarians also. They are, of course, the equivalents of our ''p'', ''b'', ''m''.\n\n50. The numerical relation of the labials are a little peculiar. Owing to the absence (or almost entire absence) of ''b'' in Indo-European, the Sanskrit b also is greatly exceeded in frequency by bh, which is the most common of all the sonant aspirates, as ph is the least common of the surd. The nasal m (notwithstanding its frequent euphonic mutations when final: 212 ff.) occurs just about as often as all the other four members of the series together.\n\na. From an early period in the history of the language, but increasingly later, b and v exchange with one another, or fail to be distinguished in the manuscripts. Thus, the double root-forms b\u1e5bh and v\u1e5bh, b\u0101dh and vadh, and so on. In the Bengal manuscripts, v is widely written instead of more original b.\n\n51. Semivowels: \u092f\u094d y, \u0930\u094d r, \u0932\u094d l, \u0935\u094d v.\n\na. The name given to this class of sounds by the Hindu grammarians is anta\u1e25sth\u0101 ''standing between'' \u2014 either from their character as utterances intermediate between vowel and consonant, or (more probably) from the circumstance of their being placed between the mutes and spirants in the arrangement of the consonants.\n\nb. The semivowels are clearly akin with the several mute series in their physical character, and they are classified along with those series \u2014 though not without some discordances of view \u2014 by the Hindu grammarians. They are said to be produced with the organs slightly in contact (\u012b\u1e63atsp\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da), or in imperfect contact (du\u1e25sp\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da).\n\n52. The \u0930\u094d r is clearly shown by its influence in the euphonic processes of the language to be a lingual sound, or one made with the tip of the tongue turned up into the dome of the palate. It thus resembles the English smooth ''r'', and, like this, seems to have been untrilled.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "46"}

None of the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas, however, does so; nor are they entirely consistent with one another in its description. For the most part, they define it as made at \u201cthe roots of the teeth\u201d. This would give it a position like that of the vibrated ''r''; but no authority hints at a vibration as belonging to it.</p>\n\nb. In point of frequency, r stands very high on the list of consonants; it is nearly equal with v, n, m, and y, and only exceeded by t.\n\n53. The \u0932\u094d l is a sound of dental position, and is so defined and classed by all the native authorities.\n\na. The peculiar character of an ''l''-sound, as involving expulsion at the side of the tongue along with contact at its tip, is not noticed by any Hindu phonetist.\n\nb. The semivowels r and l are very widely interchangeable in Sanskrit, both in roots and in suffixes, and even in prefixes: there are few roots containing a l which do not show also forms with r; words written with the one letter are found in other texts, or in other parts of the same text, written with the other. In the later period of the language they are more separated, and the l becomes decidedly more frequent, though always much rarer than the r (only as 1 to 7 or 8 or 10).\n\n{{anchor|54}}54. Some of the Vedic texts have another ''l''-sound, written with a slightly different character (it is given at the end of the alphabet, 5), which is substituted for a lingual \u1e0d (as also the same followed by h for a \u1e0dh) when occurring between two vowels. It is, then, doubtless a lingual ''l'', one made by breach (at the side of the tongue) of the lingual instead of the dental mute-closure.\n\na. Examples are \u0908\u0933\u0947 \u012b\u1e3be, for \u0908\u0921\u0946 \u012b\u1e0de, but \u0908\u0921\u094d\u092f i\u1e0dya; \u092e\u0940\u0933\u094d\u0939\u0941\u0937\u0946 m\u012b\u1e3bhu\u1e63e, for \u092e\u0940\u0922\u0941\u0937\u0947 m\u012b\u1e0dhu\u1e63e, but \u092e\u0940\u0922\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0928\u094d m\u012b\u1e0dhv\u0101n. It is especially in the Rig-Veda and its auxiliary literature that this substitution is usual.\n\n55. The \u092f\u094d y in Sanskrit, as in other languages generally, stands at the closest relationship with the vowel \u0907 i (short or long); the two exchange with one another in cases innumerable.\n\na. And in the Veda (as the metre shows) an i is very often to be read where, in conformity with the rules of the later Sanskrit euphony, a y is written. Thus the final i-vowel of a word remains i before an initial vowel; that of a stem maintains itself unchanged before an ending; and an ending of derivation \u2014 as ya, tya \u2014 has i instead of y. Such cases will be noticed in more detail later. The constancy of the phenomenon in certain words and classes of words shows that this was no merely optional interchange. Very probably, the Sanskrit y had everywhere more of an i-character than belongs to the corresponding European sound.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "47"}

The y is by its physical character a palatal utterance; and it is classed as a palatal semivowel by the Hindu phonetists. It is one of the most common of Sanskrit sounds.</p>\n\n57. The \u0935\u094d v is pronounced as English or French ''v'' (German ''w'') by the modern Hindus \u2014 except when preceded by a consonant in the same syllable, in which case it has rather the sound of English ''w''; and European scholars follow the same practice (with or without the same exception).\n\na. By its whole treatment in the euphony of the language, however, the v stands related to an ''u''-vowel precisely as ''y'' to an ''i''-vowel. It is, then, a ''v'' only according the original Roman value of that letter \u2014 that is to say, a ''w''-sound in the English sense; though (as was stated above for the y) it may well have been less markedly separated from ''u'' than English ''w'', or more like French ''ou'' in ''oui'' etc. But, as the original ''w'' has in most European languages been changed to ''v'' (English), so also in India, and that from a very early time: the Paninean scheme and two of the Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas (VPr. and TPr.) distinctly define the sound as made between the upper teeth and the lower lip \u2014 which, of course, identifies it with the ordinarily modern ''v''-sound. As a matter of practice, the usual pronunciation need not be seriously objected to; yet the student should not fail to note that the rules of Sanskrit euphony and the name of \u201csemivowel\u201d have no application except to a ''w''-sound in the English sense: a ''v''-sound (German ''w'') is no semivowel, but a spirant, standing on the same articulate stage with the English ''th''-sounds and the ''f''.\n\n58. The v is classed as a labial semivowel by the Hindu phonetical authorities. It has a somewhat greater frequency than the y.\n\na. In the Veda, under the same circumstances as the y (above, 55 a), v is to be read as a vowel, u.\n\nb. As to the interchange of v and b, see above, 50 a.\n\n59. Spirants. Under the name \u016b\u1e63man (literally ''head, steam, flatus''), which is usually and well represented by ''spirant'', some of the Hindu authorities include all remaining sounds of the alphabet; others apply the term only to the three sibilants and the aspiration \u2014 to which it will here also be restricted.\n\na. The term is not found in the Paninean scheme; by different treatises the guttural and labial breathings, these and the visarga, or all these and anusv\u0101ra, are also (in addition to the sibilants and h) called \u016b\u1e63man<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "48"}

The organs of utterance are described as being in the position of the mute-series to which each spirant belongs respectively, but unclosed, or unclosed in the middle.\n\n60. The \u0938\u094d s. Of the three sibilants, or surd spirants, this is the one of plainest and least questioned character: it is the ordinary European ''s'' \u2014 a hiss expelled between the tongue and the roof of the mouth directly behind the upper front teeth.\n\na. It is, then, dental, as it is classed by all the Hindu authorities. Notwithstanding the great losses which it suffers in Sanskrit euphony; by conversion to the other sibilants, to r, to visarga, etc., it is still very high among the consonants in the order of frequency, or considerably more common than both the other two sibilants together.\n\n61. The \u0937\u094d \u1e63. As to the character of this sibilant, also, there is no ground for real question: it is the one produced in the lingual position, or with the tip of the tongue reverted into the dome of the palate. It is, then, a kind of ''sh''-sound; and by European Sanskritists it is pronounced as an ordinary ''sh'' (French ''ch'', German ''sch''), no attempt being made (any more than in the case of the other lingual sounds: 45) to give it its proper lingual quality.\n\na. Its lingual character is shown by its whole euphonic influence, and it is described and classed as lingual by all the Hindu authorities (the APr. adds, i. 23, that the tongue in its utterance is trough-shaped). In its audible quality, it is a ''sh''-sound rather than a ''s''-sound; and, in the considerable variety of sibilant-utterance, even in the same community, it may coincide with the ''sh'' of some among ourselves. Yet the general and normal ''sh'' is palatal (see below, 63); and therefore the sign \u1e63, marked in accordance with the other lingual letters, is the only unexceptionable transliteration for the Hindu character.\n\nb. In modern pronunciation in India, \u1e63 is much confounded with kh; and the manuscripts are apt to exchange the characters. Some later grammatical treatises, too, take note of the relationship.\n\n62. This sibilant (as was noticed above, 46, and will be more particularly explained below, 180 ff.) is no original sound, but a product of the lingualization of s under certain euphonic conditions. The exceptions are extremely few (9 out of 145 noted occurrences: 75), and of a purely sporadic character. The Rig-Veda has (apart<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "49"}

The final \u1e63 of a root has in some cases attained a more independent value, and does not revert to s when the euphonic conditions are removed, but shows anomalous forms (225\u20136).\n\n63. The \u0936\u094d \u00e7. This sibilant is by all the native authorities classed and described as palatal, nor is there anything in its history or euphonic treatment to cast doubt on its character as such. It is, then, made with the flat of the tongue against the forward part of the palatal arch \u2014 that is to say, it is the usual and normal ''sh''-sound. By European scholars it is variously pronounced \u2014 more often, perhaps, as ''s'' than as ''sh''.\n\na. The two ''sh''-sounds, \u1e63 and \u00e7, are made in the same part of the mouth (the \u1e63 probably rather further back), but with a different part of the tongue; and they are doubtless not more unlike than, for example, the two ''t''-sounds, written \u1e6d and t; and it would be not less proper to pronounce them both as one ''sh'' than to pronounce the linguals and dentals alike. To neglect the difference of s and \u00e7 is much less to be approved. The very near relationship of \u1e63 and \u00e7 is attested by their euphonic treatment, which is to a considerable extent the same, and by their not infrequent confusion by the writers of manuscripts.\n\n64. As was mentioned above (41), the \u00e7, like c, comes from the corruption of an original ''k''-sound, by loss of mute-contact as well as forward shift of the point of production. In virtue of this derivation, it sometimes (though less often than c) \u201creverts\u201d to k \u2014 that is, the original k appears instead of it (43); while, on the other hand, as a ''sh''-sound, it is to a certain extent convertible to \u1e63. In point of frequency, it slightly exceeds the latter.\n\n65. The remaining spirant, \u0939\u094d h, is ordinarily pronounced like the usual European surd aspiration h.\n\na. This is not, however, its real character. It is defined by all the native authorities as not a surd element, but a sonant (or else an utterance intermediate between the two); and its whole value in the euphony of the language is that of a sonant: but what is its precise value is very hard to say. The Paninean scheme ranks it as guttural, as it does also a: this means nothing. The Pr\u0101ti\u00e7\u0101khyas bring it into no relation with the guttural class; one of them quotes the opinion of some authorities that \u201cit has the same position with the beginning of the following vowel\u201d (TPr. ii. 47) \u2014 which so far identifies it with our h. There is nothing in its euphonic influence to mark it as retaining any trace of gutturally articulated character.<noinclude>\n<references/></div></noinclude>", "page": "50"}
